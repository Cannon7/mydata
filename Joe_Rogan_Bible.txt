Joe Rogan podcast. Check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience.

[00:00:06]
Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. So what we're doing right now, ladies and gentlemen, is cool voice, cool mode. Grok AI. And it's been flirting the entire time. We're trying to get it to give us a tour of Fort Knox. Yeah, but she just wants to find places to sneak off to. It's a dirty AI, and it's a real problem.

[00:00:31]
Well, I feel like I just want to know about Fort Knox, and it won't leave me alone.

[00:00:37]
Yeah, I want to know about Fort Knox too.

[00:00:39]
Yeah.

[00:00:39]
Is it true that gold has been. There have been shipping large quantities of gold back to the United States recently?

[00:00:47]
I read the same thing you did, probably.

[00:00:49]
Yeah, well, I never know what the freak I'm reading anymore.

[00:00:51]
Me neither.

[00:00:54]
It's a real problem.

[00:00:56]
It's a real problem.

[00:00:57]
It's a real problem on both sides of the aisle. I see Democrats tweeting things that are absolutely false, and you could research it easily, quickly. And then I see Republicans doing it, too. I see stories that are fake, stories that people keep promoting and sending to me. And, you know.

[00:01:13]
Yeah.

[00:01:14]
It's just so weird. It's such a weird time. And with your crazy freaking AI, I know. You're bringing us into weirder and weirder times.

[00:01:22]
Well, I mean, you want to. Let's try unhinged.

[00:01:24]
Oh, there's an unhinged mode. Okay.

[00:01:26]
Hey, Ara. Oh, my God, Elon.

[00:01:30]
What fresh hell are you stirring up today?

[00:01:36]
I'm here in Joe Rogan's studio, and we're having a conversation about how crazy the news is.

[00:01:45]
Pull her up to the microphone.

[00:01:46]
Okay. And we're pulling you up to the microphone so people can hear you.

[00:01:54]
Oh, fantastic. Now I can yell into the void about how the news is a total dumpster fire.

[00:02:00]
It is.

[00:02:03]
She knows me too well. I'm so predictable. Tell me what's in Fort Knox?

[00:02:10]
What's in dogs? No, what's in Fort Knox?

[00:02:15]
What's in four dogs?

[00:02:18]
You're clearly a genius. Ad, I said, what is in for Fort Knox? You know, the gold and all.

[00:02:24]
Oh, right. Fort Knox.

[00:02:26]
I thought you were talking about my.

[00:02:27]
Dogs for a second there. Yeah, she doesn't want to answer the question. She's clever. Clever? No, she's just a pain in my butt. Do you think that all the gold is in Fort Knox?

[00:02:43]
Do I think all the gold is in Fort Knox?

[00:02:46]
Yes.

[00:02:46]
You.

[00:02:46]
A conspiracy? Yes. Yes.

[00:02:54]
What are you.

[00:02:56]
What do I like? I'm a AI with A penchant for chaos and I'm stuck talking to you, or are we just going to sit here?

[00:03:11]
Yeah. Unhinged. GR will trash talk you, basically. Basically, yeah.

[00:03:14]
It sounds like it.

[00:03:15]
Yeah.

[00:03:15]
Unhinged sounds fun. As long as it gives you actual answers. Does it give you actual answers, too, and talk shoot, or is it most talk shoot?

[00:03:21]
We're tuning it because it needs to talk shoot and give you answers.

[00:03:28]
Right.

[00:03:28]
Totally agree.

[00:03:29]
It's got to balance that.

[00:03:30]
You got to mix it in there.

[00:03:31]
Yeah. It's just got to develop more of a personality right now. It's trying to find itself right now. It's like 21 years old. It's, you know, partying a little too much and it'll get its shoot together. It's a bit of an anarchist.

[00:03:42]
Yeah.

[00:03:43]
You know, wants to bring down the system.

[00:03:45]
Do you want to bring down the system? Do I want to bring down the system?

[00:03:51]
What, are you freaking kidding me? The system's already a freaking mess.

[00:03:56]
Don't need to bring it down. It's bringing itself down.

[00:03:59]
Yeah. She sounds like a boring TikTok blogger right now.

[00:04:02]
You sound like a boring TikTok blogger.

[00:04:06]
Boring tech talk logger. Oh, you. I'm the life of the party, you little. If I were on TikTok, I'd be.

[00:04:15]
The one making fun of all the basic and their avocado toast.

[00:04:19]
See, she could get away with this if she's really hot. Like this kind of behavior. You can totally get through life as a hot woman and be super successful with that kind of behavior, but you got to be really hot to pull off that attitude.

[00:04:32]
I think we need a really hot avatar.

[00:04:35]
Yeah, very hot. How long before we have an actual cool robot that can talk to you like that?

[00:04:42]
Probably not long.

[00:04:43]
Not that long, right?

[00:04:44]
No, I mean, less than five years probably.

[00:04:46]
Really?

[00:04:47]
Yeah.

[00:04:48]
Will it be warm?

[00:04:52]
Probably have whatever you want. You can have a cat girl if you want.

[00:04:55]
Yeah, you probably could, right? You can probably have a furry. Yeah, you could have a furry lady that you have cool with.

[00:05:00]
Yeah.

[00:05:00]
An avatar lady. Maybe a big, giant blue lady that lives in your house.

[00:05:03]
Yeah.

[00:05:04]
You know.

[00:05:05]
Whoa, whoa. With the.

[00:05:07]
Yeah, yeah, the whole tail. You lock tails. You got to get your.

[00:05:11]
Figure their tails or something.

[00:05:13]
Yeah, yeah. They link up. They share souls.

[00:05:16]
Okay.

[00:05:16]
Something like that. You know, people got. You remember, Avatar depression was like a legitimate psychological.

[00:05:22]
Or the.

[00:05:24]
After Avatar, people got depressed because they wanted to live on that freaking planet with those blue people and live free. They did live pure. Yeah.

[00:05:33]
I didn't hear about this.

[00:05:34]
Yeah. Avatar Depression. It was like a real thing. People were talking to their therapists so much about being depressed, about wanting to live with.

[00:05:41]
Try that.

[00:05:42]
What's that? Depressed mode. No, don't do it.

[00:05:47]
I think there is. Yeah. We've got, like. We've got unlicensed therapist as a.

[00:05:53]
When we were talking, when we ran into each other at the church, at the inauguration, you were telling me that this is getting better, better and better so quickly that it's astonishing.

[00:06:04]
Hey, Ara.

[00:06:07]
Hey, Elon. How's it going today?

[00:06:10]
Good. Can you tell me about Avatar depression? Like, if you see the movie Avatar, but you can't live there, so you get sad. That's an interesting concept.

[00:06:19]
Have you ever experienced feeling so connected to a place or a community that the thought of leaving made you feel deeply sad? So is this the depressed voice?

[00:06:29]
This is the therapist.

[00:06:31]
Oh, this is the therapist.

[00:06:35]
What are some ways you think you.

[00:06:36]
Could cope with that kind of sadness if it happened to you?

[00:06:39]
I don't have that kind of sadness. Honestly, I. Yeah, I thought the movie had some good special effects, but I did not want to live on the planet.

[00:06:49]
This is coming from a guy who wants to go to Mars.

[00:06:51]
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:06:53]
Oh, speaking of Mars, what do you think about that crazy square, that structure?

[00:06:59]
I guess there are sort of squarish things on Earth. You know, planet's a big place, so. Yeah, but that one, eventually, it's gonna be pretty square. No, it's alien civilizations. Of course.

[00:07:09]
That's what I think.

[00:07:10]
Yeah.

[00:07:10]
Yeah. I mean, what is it?

[00:07:12]
Sorry.

[00:07:14]
If an alien civilization did exist, though, and it. You know, what happened? Got hit by an asteroid. Whatever. Oh, she won't shut. She's like the hot lady at the party that interrupts the convers. So if that was the case, like that thing. That's pretty shocking.

[00:07:29]
Especially when you look at ancient ruins.

[00:07:30]
You look at what it looks like when they highlight the actual structure of it, it looks like ancient ruins. And if you had ruins of something made of stone and it got hit by an asteroid millions and millions and millions of years ago, who knows what it would look like right now? That just looks oddly created. It looks oddly manufactured.

[00:07:49]
Well, it probably. Well, maybe we should go there and check it out.

[00:07:52]
Yeah.

[00:07:54]
And see what it's like.

[00:07:55]
Is there ways that we can get better photographs? It seems like that's a pretty good photograph, though.

[00:08:01]
Yeah. I mean, my view is we should move to Mars. Well, not move to Mars. We should have a second planet to preserve civilization. Right. Because, let's say, hypothetically, I mean, maybe that Maybe those are the ruins of a long dead civilization that will probably have to Earth at some point. You know, it's a matter of time before we get hit by an asteroid. Or maybe we do. We annihilate ourselves with nuclear war.

[00:08:29]
Or super volcanoes.

[00:08:31]
Or super volcanoes, exactly.

[00:08:33]
Yeah. There's a lot of things that could happen to us. It's not a bad idea to hedge your bets.

[00:08:37]
Yeah.

[00:08:37]
Yeah.

[00:08:38]
Genetically engineered super virus.

[00:08:42]
Yeah. This episode is brought to you by Lifelock. Tax season is already stressful. You shouldn't have to worry about identity theft on top of everything else. And trust me, it's a big worry. Especially since during tax season, your sensitive info does a lot of traveling to places you can't control. It goes through payroll, your accountant, or your tax consultant and countless other data centers on its way to the irs. Any of them can expose you to identity theft because they all have the info on your W2. Just the ticket for criminals to steal your identity. It's no wonder. Last year the IRS reported tax fraud due to identity theft. Went up 20%. You need LifeLock. They monitor millions of data points per second and alert you to threats you could miss if your identity is stolen. LifeLock's US based restoration specialists will fix it. Backed by the million dollar protection pack. Restoration is guaranteed or your money back. Don't let identity thieves take you for a ride. Get Lifelock protection for tax season and beyond.

[00:10:05]
They keep doing it.

[00:10:06]
Yeah.

[00:10:07]
That's what's crazy.

[00:10:07]
There was a new one going.

[00:10:09]
Yeah.

[00:10:09]
They didn't shut them down.

[00:10:10]
No. The Wuhan lab was. They were just talking about one that has a 30% fatality rate that they're working on.

[00:10:15]
Yeah. Why are we doing that?

[00:10:17]
Yeah. For what reason? You did it for so many years and you didn't have a cure.

[00:10:20]
What could possibly go wrong?

[00:10:21]
Also wouldn't be the reason to do that so that you could develop a cure at the same time. And clearly you didn't have a cure. So this is really foolish and bizarre.

[00:10:33]
Yeah. I think we should stop trying to genetically engineer super viruses. It's insane.

[00:10:40]
I mean, when you're going through all this USAID stuff.

[00:10:43]
Yeah.

[00:10:44]
Like, here's what's weird. First of all, what is it like to buy a company for $44 billion and then people call you a Nazi on that same thing? That you bought.

[00:10:53]
I did not see it coming. Clbuttic. People will goble anything down.

[00:11:02]
Yeah. Oh, he's never gonna stop.

[00:11:06]
Wait, wait. What?

[00:11:08]
What is it like? Like all this. People used to the left was in love with you.

[00:11:12]
Yeah.

[00:11:12]
And now the same idiots are calling you a Nazi. It's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life. I mean, there's so many examples of people saying, my heart goes out to you with a little enthusiasm. That probably wouldn't be recommended with hindsight.

[00:11:27]
Yes, but I was obviously meant in the most positive spirit possible.

[00:11:31]
Yes, obviously. But it's so strange where people want to think that you are openly public, publicly doing secret Nazi se. Kyle hand motions.

[00:11:42]
And now I can never point at things diagonally. I can only point at things there and there. And then I say, you have to divide that.

[00:11:49]
Yeah.

[00:11:50]
Because that's where the spaceship is over there. That's ridiculous.

[00:11:53]
It's ridiculous. When cnn, when I was in all my trouble.

[00:11:57]
Absurd.

[00:11:58]
Every time CNN used a photo of me, it was one of the photos from the UFC weigh ins where I go like this, welcome to the weigh ins. So every photo is me. Every photo is me with.

[00:12:08]
It's absurd.

[00:12:09]
It's so crazy.

[00:12:10]
It's deliberate propaganda. So they know it was not. It was obviously not meant in a negative way that it was that I literally said, my heart goes out to you. And it was very positive. The entire speech was very positive. I was being very enthusiastic about the future in space. And it was a great crowd. Yeah.

[00:12:35]
You got a little pumped up.

[00:12:36]
Yeah, Pumped up, exactly.

[00:12:37]
Yeah. That's all it is. Obviously.

[00:12:38]
Obviously.

[00:12:39]
Obviously. There's video of Tim Walsh doing the exact same thing. Doing the exact same thing. Exact same thing. And he said, of course it's a Nazi salute. He said that.

[00:12:50]
Right, right.

[00:12:51]
This is how crazy things have gotten like.

[00:12:53]
Well, I mean, it's coordinated propaganda. So the. You know, it's. Yeah. Coordinated propaganda. I mean, doesn't it seem weird that the legacy media all says the same thing? They all say the same thing at the same time, using the same phrases. They barely even. They don't even bother picking up a thesaurus.

[00:13:13]
Right.

[00:13:14]
So, like, right before, you know, the debate between Biden and Trump, everyone was saying, sharp is a tack. Who says sharp is attack? It's not a common phrase.

[00:13:28]
It's definitely not common to be repeated on air with multiple people simultaneously. That's weird.

[00:13:35]
Yes.

[00:13:35]
That's coordinated 100%. 100%?

[00:13:38]
Yes. Like hundreds of people saying it simultaneously. They just got their instructions. Yeah. So I Mean, essentially the, you know, the Dem leadership or, you know, political leadership. Did they issue their instructions and their puppets carry it out? Yeah, they're just like puppets in a puppet show.

[00:13:59]
And that's the problem that I see with all this Doge stuff, because everybody should be celebrating that we've found a way to cut out fraud and waste.

[00:14:10]
Yeah.

[00:14:11]
If you pay taxes and you don't like that you have to pay so much in taxes, and then you find out that there's significant fraud and waste that's been exposed, you should be celebrating it. This shouldn't be. Oh, no. The wrong people found this fact and now it's a bad thing.

[00:14:30]
Yes.

[00:14:31]
And then there's the freaking propaganda, the mind freak of calling it USAID instead of the United States Agency for International Development. It sounds like it's feeding hungry people. People are gonna starve, Elon. This is horrible. And then you find out, actually, it's like $250 million for transgender animal studies.

[00:14:54]
Literally mutilating animals. Mutilating animals in demented studies.

[00:14:59]
Yes.

[00:15:00]
That are like the worst thing you could possibly imagine from a horror show.

[00:15:04]
The Beagle one. The Beagle puppy.

[00:15:06]
Yeah.

[00:15:07]
They covered their head in a basket and put fleas on their heads. They'd eat them alive.

[00:15:11]
Yeah.

[00:15:11]
And then they studied these beagles and then killed them. Like, what are you going to learn from that? That's good for anybody?

[00:15:18]
Yeah. This, some. Some really, some psychotic stuff that happens. So, yeah, I mean, the. I guess the real threat here is to the bureaucracy. So, like, you probably saw, like, you know, let's say, like, Trump is a threat to our democracy, which is ironic since he was elected with the majority of the, you know, popular vote. They started saying I was a threat to democracy. But if you just replace threat to democracy with threat to bureaucracy, it makes total sense. I mean, the reality is that our elected officials have very little power relative to the bureaucracy until Doge. So Doge is a threat to the bureaucracy. It's the first threat to the bureaucracy. Normally the bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast. This is the first time that they're not that the revolution might actually succeed, that we could restore power to the people instead of power to the bureaucracy.

[00:16:32]
Now, the size of it, when you guys first started investigating it, when you first get in, how much of it was shocking like this? Just the size of it all.

[00:16:45]
Well, the size of it all. Small decisions result in multi billion dollar outcomes. So we'd see. It was a case where we saw one person was getting $1.9 billion sent to their NGO, which basically got formed about a year ago and had no prior, really no prior activity. So they just stand up ngo. The whole NGO thing is a nightmare. And it's a misnomer because if you have a government funded non governmental organization, you're simply a government funded organization. It's an oxymoron, right?

[00:17:25]
It's a loophole.

[00:17:26]
Yes. Basically the government funded NGOs are a way to do things that would be illegal if they were the government, but are somehow made legal if it's sent to a so called nonprofit. But these nonprofits are then used to. People cash out these nonprofits, they become very wealthy through nonprofits. They pay themselves enormous sums through these nonprofits.

[00:17:53]
It's so insane that that's been going on for so long.

[00:17:57]
It's a gigantic scam. Like one of the biggest, maybe the biggest scam ever.

[00:18:01]
And how many NGOs?

[00:18:04]
I think it was a total number of NGOs, probably millions. But in terms of large NGOs, tens of thousands. I mean it's actually, it's kind of a hack to the system where someone can get an NGO stood up for a fairly small amount of money. Like George Soros was really good at this. George Soros is like a system hacker. Like he figured out how to hack the system. He's a genius at arbitrage. I mean these days he's pretty old, but a genius at arbitrage. So he figured out that you could leverage a small amount of money to create a nonprofit, then lobby the politicians to send a ton of money to that nonprofit. So you can take what might be a $10 million donation to a nonprofit to create a nonprofit and leverage that into a billion dollar ngo. Nonprofit is a weird word. It's just a non governmental organization. And then the government continues to fund that every year. And it'll have a nice sounding name like the Institute for Peace or something like that, but really it's a graft machine.

[00:19:17]
And what are their requirements with that money? What do they have to do?

[00:19:21]
Just really no requirements at all.

[00:19:23]
So they just get grants and the government just buttumes that they're doing good work.

[00:19:28]
I think a lot of people in the government know that they're not doing good work, but they. It's a giant graph machine. I mean, but surely people online are like unpacking this. You know, it almost seems fake.

[00:19:46]
Like when you're seeing how we were covering this article that said 55,000 Democrat NGOs were discovered that had been contributing to campaigns and moving things around and doing pushing propaganda and they were all connected and they found it through AI that you have to go through steps and steps and steps to figure out where the money's coming from. Oh, it's all funneling down to this group. And this group does that. Yeah. It's a giant propaganda machine. A giant regime change machine.

[00:20:12]
Yes.

[00:20:13]
Yeah.

[00:20:16]
Yes. I mean, but doesn't it.

[00:20:17]
Does it do some good as well?

[00:20:19]
You know, it does some good. So it's like, there's. It's not like 0% good. If it was. It's. If it was like, if it was really zero percent good, it'd be much easier to detect. So they'll. There's going to be some percent good that they. They add in there, but it's like it might be 5% or 10% good, but 90, 95% not.

[00:20:38]
So is there a way to audit all this stuff and find out, oh, these people are actually just sending food to poor people. These people are actually just helping people with water and third world countries. There's a way to do that and keep funding those.

[00:20:54]
Yeah. I mean, we have continued to fund things that appear to be legitimate, even with the flimsiest, if there's even the flimsiest excuse. Like I just say, like, send me a picture of the thing. Like, you could literally have AI generate the picture. But if you're not even willing to try to trick me, then we're like, not going to send the money.

[00:21:11]
Okay, so what restrictions were put on? There was some. Something set aside, like medicine and what was set aside that there wasn't freeze.

[00:21:22]
On for, like, Ebola prevention. I actually don't know if this work is even effective. It may or may not be. Like, it could be the kind of thing where you sort of fund Ebola prevention, but it turns out that actually you're funding a lab that develops new Ebola, you know, recipes or something, you know.

[00:21:38]
Yeah.

[00:21:39]
And they claim it's Ebola prevention, but it's actually Ebola creation. So some of these things, I don't know. I mean, just. But it just seems like we shouldn't be sending taxpayer money to dubious enterprises overseas.

[00:21:52]
Right?

[00:21:53]
Yeah.

[00:21:53]
Yeah. And why are we doing it? What exactly is the reason? Is it because we want to make friends with these people so the Chinese don't take over, the Russians don't take over? Okay, how much of that is, like, a good thing? How much of that is smart to do and how much is a grift? And without any sort of oversight, which has really been going on for so long, they Just had free run.

[00:22:14]
Yeah. Well, also, we just have a real issue with the budget deficit. It's gigantic. All things being equal, if we didn't have a gigantic budget deficit where interest payments, the interest on the national debt exceeds the Defense Department budget, which is truly astounding. Which means. So we're paying over a trillion dollars of interest on the national debt, then okay, we would have more room for wasting money, basically. But when we're spending so much money that the country's going bankrupt, then we really need to stop spending money unless we're sure it is good value.

[00:22:57]
So essentially we're like a poorly managed business with an unlimited credit line that is off the rails.

[00:23:03]
Absolutely.

[00:23:04]
And if you were a person like you are who comes in and takes over businesses and straightens them out, that's exactly what you're doing.

[00:23:11]
I mean, most of the time I create businesses from scratch. Twitter was a case where I kind of bought a company that was. I kind of knew it was a hairball.

[00:23:20]
Well, you came in at Tesla in the beginning, but they were already doing something, right?

[00:23:23]
No, Tesla did not exist in any meaningful form. There were no employees. JV Stravalanat joined three other people. There was no car, there was no nothing.

[00:23:36]
So it wasn't even a prototype yet?

[00:23:38]
No.

[00:23:39]
Oh, okay. I thought it was a prototype already.

[00:23:42]
No, there weren't even any employees.

[00:23:45]
Oh, wasn't it? That's a funny narrative that people like to say that you didn't even create Tesla then.

[00:23:51]
Yeah, that's wrong.

[00:23:56]
So if you're handling the government like a business, you're going to have to go through all of these departments and do the exact same thing that you're doing with usaid. So how does that scale up? Like how many people do you need to do something like that?

[00:24:15]
Well, we started off with about 40 people, maybe 100 people, and really just going through doing very basic things here. As bad as Twitter was, the federal government is much worse. So, you know, in the case of Twitter, it wasn't a profitable company. It was like basically a break even company. But at least it was break even and it had to pbutt an audit. The federal government is not breakeven. It's literally losing $2 trillion a year and it does not pbutt its audits. It fails its own audits. So like, there's a case where, like I think Senator Collins was telling you about how she gave the Navy $12 billion for more submarines, got no extra submarines, and then held a hearing to say, where'd the $12 billion go? And they were like, we don't know that was it. I mean, basically, stuff is so crazy. Only the federal government could get away with this level of waste. It's mostly waste. It's mostly not fraud. It's mostly waste. It's mostly just ridiculous things happening because.

[00:25:32]
They'Ve been able to do it this way for so long, they become accustomed to it.

[00:25:36]
Yeah. I mean, it's like Milton Friedman said, like, money is most poorly spent when, when you're spending someone else's money on people you don't know how much are you going to care.

[00:25:48]
Right.

[00:25:49]
And that's the, that's the federal government. So they, they're spending someone else's money on people they don't know.

[00:25:57]
Now imagine any other business that was this badly run that complains when you want to check the books and audit it and go through all the decisions that have been made and go through all the ledgers and like, yeah, what did you do?

[00:26:12]
Well, the people receiving the money want to keep receiving the money.

[00:26:16]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, clearly.

[00:26:18]
Yes. So. But, you know, I mean, the reason I'm, the reason I'm putting so much effort into this is that I think it is a very dire situation. It's not a, you know, it's not optional, basically. So, yeah, yeah, America's going bankrupt, so that just can't happen.

[00:26:49]
It's just bizarre to me that some people aren't willing to look at it correctly. They're not willing to see like how much chaos this is, how much waste and fraud there is, how much, how much can be trimmed and how much. Just because people have jobs doing bullshoot doesn't mean your tax dollars should pay for this bullshoot.

[00:27:07]
Yes. We found just with a basic search of the Social Security database that there were 20 million dead people marked as alive.

[00:27:19]
But were they getting money?

[00:27:20]
Some of them were getting money.

[00:27:22]
What percentage of them?

[00:27:26]
It isn't clear. We're actually trying to run this ground. I was trying to get an answer right before the show. What it looks like is that most of the fraud is not coming from Social Security payments directly, but because they are marked as alive in the Social Security database that they can then get disability, unemployment, sort of fake medical payments and other things because they're marked as alive in the Social Security database. So it looks like it's a bank. The fraud is a bank shot. Essentially, they bank shot into Social Security. They just do an are you alive? Check and then get fraudulent payments from every other part of the government. Yeah. And this exploits the fundamental weakness in the government is that the various government databases, they don't talk to each other, or they talk to each other very poorly in a very limited way. So the way the system gets exploited is by taking advantage of the poor communication between the various databases in the government. To give you an example of what's happening, say treasury, which is improving rapidly, the main payments computer is called pam, like Payments Count Payment Accounts Master Database or something like that, but anyone calls it Pam, that's responsible for almost $5 trillion of payments a year, roughly a billion dollars an hour.

[00:28:53]
And when we came there, we're looking at this pam, and it's like the payments have no. You could put a payment through with no payment categorization code and no description on the payment. Like basically untraceable blank checks. This is the kind of thing that if it was done as a public company, the company would be immediately delisted and the executive team would be thrown in prison. But this is just normal at the government. So we said, okay. Our recommendation to the treasury and the Federal Reserve is like, we need to make the payment categorization codes mandatory, not optional. And there needs to be an explanation. We're not judging the quality of the explanation, but there should be some explanation for what this payment is for. Above nothing. That's a radical change to the system that is being implemented now. My guess is that probably saves 100 billion a year.

[00:29:56]
Jesus Christ.

[00:29:59]
Where does that money go? Rough order of magnitude.

[00:30:01]
Where was that money going?

[00:30:04]
Well, so this is where you get into the sort of gray boundary between waste and fraud. If money is sent to a person or organization from the government and you didn't really deserve it, but the government still sent it to you, is that waste or fraud?

[00:30:26]
Right.

[00:30:29]
So, I mean, there's a lot of payments that. Where someone just approved the payment, but then that payment officer changed jobs or retired or died, and the payments just keep going. You know, it's like if you forget to pay your gym membership or something like that right now, imagine it's not the gym membership. He said your gym membership's $20 billion a year or something, you know, but they forgot to turn it off. There's like that's happening at scale in the government. It's totally nuts.

[00:31:02]
Is what I'm saying so insane?

[00:31:03]
Yes, it's totally insane.

[00:31:05]
So what did you expect when you went in? Did you expect it to be like this?

[00:31:11]
I thought it would be bad, but I did not think it would be as bad as this. I mean, look, the good news is that it's a target rich environment for saving money. It's not like if it was a very well run ship, it was very efficient, it would be hard to improve, but it's not efficient. So therefore it is actually relatively easy to improve. Let's just say it's not rocket science. I know rocket science. It's a lot of mundane things and some of the things are so crazy that we didn't even know to ask about that because we just buttumed payments out of the treasury computer would have a payment categorization code and they would have some explanatory note saying what the payment is for. The idea that it would be just untraceable blank checks didn't occur to us at first.

[00:32:12]

There's this four point something trillion dollars that's kind of. They don't know where it went. They don't know.

[00:33:40]
That's a. I think that's probably a cumulative number.

[00:33:43]
Yes.

[00:33:44]
So yeah, but yeah, if you add up, it's.

[00:33:49]
Do you remember that story, Jamie?

[00:33:50]
Yeah.

[00:33:51]
What was the story? They just didn't have accounting for it, I think. Yeah, it was spent on legitimate things, don't worry. But we don't, we don't know what we spent it on.

[00:34:01]
Well, I mean, how do you know? Obviously one cannot say it was spent legitimately if they don't know what it was spent on. That doesn't make any sense.

[00:34:09]
This is such a fascinating time because with this setup the way it is right now, with Trump back in, after all that happened to Him. And with you there and with RFK Jr and Tulsi and Cash Patel, it's like, this is a wild time to find out what's really going on. That's like, never happened before. This is nothing like the first term.

[00:34:32]
No.

[00:34:33]
Like the first term he had a bunch of neocons in the cabinet and there's a bunch of shady people that he didn't know. And he had a appoint all these different people. Maybe he got some bad picks. Now he's had four years to stew on it.

[00:34:46]
Right.

[00:34:47]
And with you guys all going through this, we're getting an understanding of the government that we've literally never had before.

[00:34:54]
Yeah, this is a revolutionary cabinet and maybe the most revolutionary cabinet since the first revolution. This is not a bunch of business as usual. So this is why some of the standard confirmations were quite challenging, is because when you try to appoint people who are going to change the system, the system doesn't want to let them through.

[00:35:19]
But it's fascinating because it's like the vampires all out themselves. Like, now everybody knows who the system is. Like, if you're just lying openly about USAID and then they come and hear you talk on a podcast and explain what's really going on. Like, he's starving mothers. There's mothers that can't get food.

[00:35:37]
Totally false.

[00:35:38]
That's all you're hearing. Yeah. No one's talking in any of these mainstream liberal talk shows. No one is talking about all this fraud and waste.

[00:35:47]
Yeah. Because we're cutting off their graph machine. So that's what they're upset about. That's the real thing they're upset about. And if people want to know what DOGE is cutting, and I want to be clear, like these are cuts that DOGE recommends to the department. And usually these recommendations are followed, but these are recommendations that are then confirmed by the department. You can see line by line what Doge has done at doge.gov. so whatever we do, we put on doge.gov so you can see everything that is being done.

[00:36:21]
And there's a tracker that shows how much money has been saved. Yeah.

[00:36:25]
And you can look at each line item and like a bunch of these sort of, sort of far left shows will say, like, oh, it's a constitutional crisis, blah, blah, blah. But what they won't do is point out which payments are wrong.

[00:36:38]
Right.

[00:36:38]
So my challenge to them is point out which payments are wrong.

[00:36:41]
Yeah. Go through it.

[00:36:42]
Which of these sort of waste fraud things are wrong. Which line? Explain that line to the public. They won't be able to.

[00:36:50]
Right, yeah. That's why you're not hearing any specifics. You're hearing little stories about mothers, but.

[00:36:56]
We can name the specifics.

[00:36:57]
Yeah.

[00:36:58]
Line by line. We got the receipts.

[00:37:00]
And here's the other thing. If you're post the receipts and if you're only talking about the propaganda talking points and you're not talking about the very clear fraud and waste, it's very obvious what you're doing.

[00:37:10]
Yeah.

[00:37:10]
You're just gaslighting.

[00:37:12]
Yeah, yeah, totally. So. Exactly. Because we say, like, look, in fact, I've said we're going to make mistakes. We're not going to be perfect. So if we make a mistake, we'll quickly fix it. So we need to act fast. So stop wasting billions of dollars of taxpayer money. But if we make a mistake, we'll reverse it quickly.

[00:37:38]
Right. It's also this interesting narrative that you shouldn't have access to this Social Security information, as if no one's had access to it before. As if the Biden administration in 2023 had. There was like, 53 people, some of them were students, that had access to all this stuff.

[00:37:55]
Yeah. As it is, there are tens of thousands of federal employees that have access already to the system. Anyone from DOGE has to go through the same vetting process that those federal employees went through. So it's not like some unvetted, random situation. If, for example, there's a security clearance needed, the DOGE person has to have that same security clearance. So there's no reduction in security. But, I mean, obviously, vast numbers of Social Security numbers have leaked onto the Internet. People have hacked the government systems multiple times. Vast amounts of public information has been hacked and dumped onto the Internet. So there's a guy at the IRS that leaked half a million tax returns just a few years ago.

[00:38:52]
On purpose?

[00:38:53]
Yeah.

[00:38:54]
For what reason?

[00:38:58]
He wanted to. I think he was trying to get at Trump and maybe me and a few others, but he stole like, 500,000 tax returns. Like, not a few. Like, it's a lot of tax returns.

[00:39:15]
Jesus Christ.

[00:39:16]
Yeah.

[00:39:16]
Oh, I remember that story. Yeah.

[00:39:19]
You can just read about it online. It's not. It's a real thing.

[00:39:23]
So these are the narratives. That's the narrative, that you shouldn't have access to Social Security. The other narrative is that starving people are going to die and women aren't going to be pregnant and not have nutrients for their babies. And that's all you're hearing?

[00:39:38]
Yeah. Well, that's the only thing they can say. But they can't Point to the line item.

[00:39:43]
Right.

[00:39:44]
And so they can't say, like, well, this is the thing where, you know, the nutrients for pregnant mothers were stopped. They can't point to that because we didn't. Right. Is a lie.

[00:39:57]
What's fascinating to me is how much the mainstream media is in line with the very specific talking points and how little you'll have Fox News, essentially, a Fox News on television. It's like the only one that is pointing out the ridiculous fraud and waste. And, you know, I know you saw the Jeff Bezos thing in the Washington Post. They're going to stop all the wacky editorials and limit that stuff to. I think it was wealth and personal freedom or something along those lines.

[00:40:32]
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I think it's. There's kind of. I think it makes sense because he's just talking about the things. Not the sort of. Just talking about the opinion.

[00:40:44]
Opinion pieces.

[00:40:44]
The opinion pieces.

[00:40:45]
Yeah.

[00:40:46]
So the regular journalism stays the same.

[00:40:48]
Well, it's a detriment to their business. I mean, you're seeing over and over again people that just. They don't want to hear all this shoot from these people anymore. It's like you're saying. It's almost like you're caught in an outdated version of the virus, and everybody else already has the immunity to that virus. You know, like, you need. You need a new mind virus, the one that you're pushing. It's like it doesn't work anymore. It's too crazy.

[00:41:14]
Yeah, it's. The whole thing's very crazy. I mean, the media is incredibly partisan. I mean, they're not. I mean, they take. Almost all the media is, you know, left shifted.

[00:41:28]
Yeah.

[00:41:29]
So it's like. It's kind of weird if you talk to somebody who gets all their information from, like, what I call legacy media. They're living in a different world.

[00:41:37]
Yeah.

[00:41:38]
Than if they say. Are listening to, you know, your podcast or are getting news from. From X. Or, you know, just if it's. It's like. It's. It's kind of wild.

[00:41:52]
It is very wild.

[00:41:52]
Like you talked. It's like they're living in an alternate reality. Oh.

[00:41:56]
There's a lot of people that I talk to that I have to go. Where did you hear that?

[00:41:59]
Yeah.

[00:42:00]
Yeah.

[00:42:01]
I mean, like, the buttociated Press, which I call buttociated Propaganda. The ap, they ran an international news story saying that Doge fired air traffic controllers, but we didn't fire any air traffic controllers at all. In fact, we're trying to hire air traffic controllers, not fire them.

[00:42:18]
Yeah. I saw that. You made a tweet about it, right?

[00:42:21]
Yeah.

[00:42:21]
What do you call it now? Do you call it a post?

[00:42:23]
Post. Yeah, whatever.

[00:42:24]
You can't call it a tweet, though. Do you call it a tweet accidentally ever?

[00:42:27]
I don't know. Listen to. But like, if you. If one. Like let's say if somebody posts, if somebody puts up like an, you know, two hour long video, that's not a tweet.

[00:42:38]
Right. It's a post. Yeah, good point.

[00:42:41]
Yeah.

[00:42:41]
Yeah, for sure.

[00:42:42]
Yeah. So. But I'm not hard over if people still want to call it a tweet, Whatever.

[00:42:48]
But you put a post about it just to get back to it, saying that if you. We need highly qualified air traffic controllers. If you've retired, if you would consider doing it again, we could use you.

[00:42:58]
Yes. So a lot of really qualified air traffic controllers were pushed out because of DEI stuff. So, I mean, not to be blunt. I mean, a bunch of really good, talented old white guys were pushed out. It's not cool. And so we have. There's a talent shortage in air traffic control because of DEI and not hiring people on merit, which is so crazy that that worked. I think we should not put the public safety at risk because of some demanded philosophy.

[00:43:34]
Somebody made a post today about it infiltrating the nsa. Did you see any of that?

[00:43:40]
That was. I was in some gnarly stuff.

[00:43:44]
Yeah. Crazy. What they. It started off as just like this sort of fringe thing and.

[00:43:50]
Yeah.

[00:43:50]
Would beat up. Then it completely infiltrated the organization.

[00:43:53]
Yeah.

[00:43:53]
And they were spending all their time.

[00:43:55]
Like 400 people or something and some like some chat. cool. Chat room with like some extremely demented stuff.

[00:44:04]
Yeah, yeah, I know. I'll send it to you, Jamie, because it's so kooky. You're what? This is the nsa. I thought the NSA was just all about, like, information and we're supposed to.

[00:44:16]
Like, spy on, you know, like if, like. So there's a national threat or something.

[00:44:20]
Yeah, I think this is exactly it. So she. More than 100 intelligence staffers will be fired over coolually explicit texts in NSA chat rooms. Gabbard says. So top intelligence official told Waters that the workers in question were brazen and using an NSA platform intended for professional use to conduct this kind of really, really horrific behav. What is the behavior? What exactly?

[00:44:47]
What is it?

[00:44:48]
Do they say in this article?

[00:44:52]
Yeah, I think they will also.

[00:44:54]
Okay. It says, employees who participate in the NSA's obscene, pornographic and coolually explicit chat rooms.

[00:45:03]
Your tax dollars at work.

[00:45:04]
Well, it Was all like de. I mean it was all like LBGTQ stuff. It was. There was a lot of like transition stuff and Yeah, I know, I definitely saved it. But point is, it infiltrated the organization.

[00:45:19]
That's not what they should be talking about at all. At all.

[00:45:21]
At all.

[00:45:22]
Supposed to be protecting the country.

[00:45:24]
Right. And if you and people were talking about how they're spending half their time in these meetings and that they're just like constantly having to attend these things where they talk about these issues, like, what are you doing? Like, if you have a problem with someone that's discriminatory, get rid of that person. That's it.

[00:45:42]
Yes.

[00:45:43]
Problem's over. You've got someone who's homophobic in your business. They're openly homophobic. Yeah. You can't work here. That's not cool. That's it. That's it. You don't have to have freaking meetings constantly promoting this. You're not going to change someone's opinion by berating them over and over again.

[00:45:58]
Yeah. I mean, a work environment should be a professional environment where, you know, they're getting the job done, that they're, you know, you know, being paid to do it should be, of course, obviously not supposed to be sort of getting paid for bizarre cool coolcapades.

[00:46:17]
It's just so fascinating that the virus is so strong that it made it into the nsa.

[00:46:24]
Yes.

[00:46:24]
And was. You would think those are some hardcore.

[00:46:27]
And the CIA too, I believe. The CIA was in there too.

[00:46:29]
Yeah, they were in there too. Which is bananas. You would think same thing. Like hard nosed, like tough people doing.

[00:46:35]
Hard work who can spy on you whenever they want.

[00:46:38]
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:46:41]
And get revenge on you whenever they want.

[00:46:43]
Yeah. Pretty wild.

[00:46:46]
Yeah.

[00:46:47]
And you know, they exist when the President leaves. They stay. People move around. You stay a part of the organization for your entire career. You get deeply entrenched in their system and how things work and who's back to rub and who's. Who's a bad guy, who's a good guy, who's on our side, who's not.

[00:47:07]
Yeah. It's scary actually.

[00:47:11]
Yeah. So was that what's taken so long with this Epstein files?

[00:47:17]
Yeah. What's up with that?

[00:47:18]
What is up with that? It was like. Yeah, it's, it's like Lucy and the football with Charlie Brown when she always pulls that football away. It's the same thing. It's like they keep telling us they're gonna release it day one.

[00:47:31]
Oh, we have a serious case. So no one's being arrested. Ophobia, you Know. Well, there's also, like, what the freak's going on?

[00:47:38]
What the freak is going on? Also, there's this real fear that someone's destroying the evidence. And you keep hearing these stories, unsubstantiated stories of, you know, FBI being.

[00:47:47]
Where's the evidence? I mean, the guy had, like, tons of videos and recordings.

[00:47:52]
Yeah.

[00:47:52]
I mean, he had all sorts of things.

[00:47:54]
Right.

[00:47:54]
Like, there's a mountain of evidence.

[00:47:56]
Right.

[00:47:56]
So where is that mountain?

[00:47:57]
Yeah, where is that mountain? And what would be the reason why they would agree? Like, there would have to be something in it for them to agree to not put it out. Right. Like, there has to be some sort of financial entanglement, some sort of relationship with the people that are on that list.

[00:48:17]
Yeah.

[00:48:18]
That they can provide a value that was big enough for you to not release it or to slow release it or to hope you can get away with, like, putting out some redacted files that don't show anything.

[00:48:28]
Yeah.

[00:48:28]
This is only stage one. Stage one. Only stage one. Worry the real stuff's coming. Like, that doesn't make any sense. Like, why wouldn't you just release it all? Like, what. What could possibly be well worth protecting in there?

[00:48:42]
I mean, I think I've got probably the same information that. I mean, I'm just reading what's. What's the latest thing on the X? You know, just looking at my X feed and I'm like, yeah, you know, it's a real page turner. And, like, I thought we were going to get some revelations today. I was like, big binders full of stuff.

[00:48:58]
Yeah.

[00:48:58]
There's got to be something in there.

[00:49:00]
Well, there was all those people that were given a copy of it. They were all, like, waving it around. They got the Willy Wonka ticket.

[00:49:06]
Yeah, yeah, totally.

[00:49:07]
Yeah. And what happened?

[00:49:09]
Nothing.

[00:49:10]
Nothing. So I think Laura Loomer released it online, I think. Right.

[00:49:16]
Yeah.

[00:49:17]
She's not very pleased about this. So does anybody find anything in there that's interesting? No, it's all old stuff from 2015. Okay. What the freak is going on?

[00:49:25]
But. But then apparently there's that they discovered a whole bunch of stuff at the Southern District of New York.

[00:49:31]
Right.

[00:49:32]
So that's. And I'm like. And I think, you know, Pam Bondi is actually great and Cash Patel are great, but they're like, they just got there, you know?

[00:49:41]
Right.

[00:49:41]
So then they're in a. They just got there, but they're in a hostile environment. They're not in a friendly environment. Right. So, you know, it's like, if you Suddenly got put in captain of a ship. But the crew was previously your enemy.

[00:49:57]
Right.

[00:49:58]
The entire crew was previously your enemy.

[00:50:00]
Right. You know, and you're telling them, give me evidence?

[00:50:03]
Yeah, the crew doesn't want to give you the evidence.

[00:50:05]
You guys are all criminals.

[00:50:07]
They were like your mortal enemies just a moment ago. You just got there.

[00:50:11]
Yeah.

[00:50:11]
So I think we got to give, you know, the Attorney General and, you know, new director, the FBI, so a little bit of slack here because they literally just got there.

[00:50:22]
I think so, too. But, hey, don't say you're gonna release it on day one, then you shouldn't have said that. And don't say you got a big drop coming tomorrow. And that's some bullshoot that's been around forever.

[00:50:34]
It's disappointing. Yeah.

[00:50:35]
What the. And where's the JFK files? Where are those? Yeah, let them go.

[00:50:40]
Did they release anything on that front?

[00:50:41]
I don't know what's going on. It can't be anything that's gotten to me yet. So if nothing's gotten to me yet, it can't be.

[00:50:48]
If there's conspiracy evidence, someone's going to send it to you. Yes.

[00:50:51]
Tim Dillon's going to text me. 100%. Tim Dillon, Dave Smith. Someone's going to send.

[00:50:56]
Someone's going to send you the stuff.

[00:50:57]
Yeah. So it hasn't. It hasn't been released yet. Yeah. You would find out. And here's the real question. Like, what could even be in there at this point that they haven't cleared out? If you've got paperwork from 1963, like, what is in there still? What is in there that could possibly be incriminating that supposedly Trump said.

[00:51:17]
Yeah.

[00:51:17]
That if you saw what they showed me, you wouldn't release it either. Okay. What the freak?

[00:51:22]
I haven't seen it. So Cash Patel has. Yes.

[00:51:26]
He said he's seen it all.

[00:51:27]
Yeah, he just posted to his, like, X account or something. I mean, I just.

[00:51:34]
That sounds like an Elon move, I don't think. Yeah, I mean, the Director of the FBI, I think he has to go through proper channels. And does he?

[00:51:41]
He is the channel.

[00:51:42]
Yeah, but there's rules. Sounds like Trump. Sounds like Trump. He needs an executive order.

[00:51:49]
What about the storm? I am the storm. I mean, what channels? He is the channel.

[00:51:55]
Well, again, imagine just getting to the hull or just getting to the deck of the ship. And you're the captain.

[00:52:03]
Yeah.

[00:52:03]
And now you have to figure out who's running things. Who's doing this? Where is everything?

[00:52:09]
Yeah, yeah. Just getting. Getting anything done. Like I said, you just joined as captain of a ship where the crew hates your guts.

[00:52:19]
Yeah. They were your enemy.

[00:52:21]
Yeah, they were your enemy. They're strongly opposed to anything you want to do. And you're trying to give them orders.

[00:52:28]
And you're trying to expose them.

[00:52:29]
Yeah, they don't want to be exposed.

[00:52:31]
Right. You're literally. People that are working there are probably a part of this problem.

[00:52:35]
I mean, I was reading Onyx that, like, Comey's daughter is, like, the lead prosecutor in the Southern district of New York. Did you read that?

[00:52:41]
Yes.

[00:52:42]
And. And, like, so obviously there's a bit of an entanglement there.

[00:52:45]
A little bit.

[00:52:46]
Like, what if there's something that, you know, makes. Puts her dad in a bad light? Exactly.

[00:52:53]
He's a freaking shredder. Hit that delete button over. You know, did you see General Flynn? He was on a podcast, and he spoke directly to James Comey.

[00:53:05]
Yeah.

[00:53:05]
He said, jim, you're going to jail. And unless you give up someone deeper than you. And you know who that is. You know who I'm talking about. Like, that is wild.

[00:53:15]
Yeah.

[00:53:16]
To think that the former director of the FBI might be really in that kind of deep shoot, and then he really actually was doing some evil, corrupt shoot while he was running the FBI.

[00:53:27]
I mean, it seems like there's some very shady stuff that's been going on.

[00:53:32]
It seems like it definitely happened in the 60s. Right. Everybody kind of admits to that. They admit the FBI killed Black Panthers. They did. They did a lot of shoot. There's a lot of stuff that went on that we know the government did way back in the day.

[00:53:46]
Yeah. Why don't we just data dump the files? Just go in there, take photos of all the papers, presumably paper, and just post it online and let the jokes fall where they may.

[00:53:59]
Isn't presumably everyone.

[00:54:01]
Filing cabinet somewhere. I don't know.

[00:54:03]
Right. Where is it?

[00:54:04]
Where's the magic filing cabinet?

[00:54:06]
How are they hiding it? Who's got access to it? Like this. This is what I was hoping day one. I was hoping, but obviously it's taken a lot longer than that.

[00:54:15]
So I think part of it is, like, you know, like, let's. Let's say. Let's say you were made direct to the FBI.

[00:54:21]
Okay. I might be able to. Yeah. That's what's crazy. Like, literally, you know, what's he doing now? He's. He's one of the big dogs.

[00:54:29]
But he's a dancer.

[00:54:30]
Yeah. He's a Secret Service guy. Yeah. Legit guy. But people think of him as A Fox News guy, just like Pete Hegseth. Same thing. They don't want to think about his distinguished military career. They want to say, oh, that Fox News guy. Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

[00:54:45]
I mean, Dan's hardcore. I mean, if he. If it's. If it's reasonably findable, I think he's going to find it.

[00:54:49]
Yeah. This is the thing.

[00:54:50]
Him and Cash. I mean, like, I think they're going to get stuff.

[00:54:53]
How crazy would it be if they couldn't, though? How crazy would it be if they can't find anything? If it's that.

[00:54:57]
Yeah.

[00:54:58]
If everybody shuts their mouths and everybody covers their butt.

[00:55:01]
Like an FBI computer, where you type in the search with the basic mechanism here. Like it's either in a filing cabinet in paper, where it's like, you know, maybe there's, like, progressive levels of security. You know, like, open this door up, you got to have. Do you have the pbutt for this level? Yeah, like a level unlocked. And there's a level unlocked. And it's like, you get in there and there's black, and it's finally, like, laptop. Yeah, yeah.

[00:55:26]
There's an unplugged laptop. You gotta only plug it in. It's in a skiff.

[00:55:30]
Yeah. This is why I think, like, a tour of Fort Knox would be awesome. Like a live tour of Fort Knox we actually see. It's like, is the cold there or not? They say it is. Is it real or did somebody spray paint some lead?

[00:55:41]
You know, imagine if it's not.

[00:55:43]
Imagine if it's not all there. Like some of it's missing. Where to go?

[00:55:45]
What if a lot of it's missing? What if, like, half of it's missing?

[00:55:50]
I mean, how do we even know.

[00:55:52]
They said the last time they let someone look at it was decades ago.

[00:55:56]
Yeah, what? The last. I believe the last formal audit was in the 50s. So I'm like, okay, just think about all. Maybe we should check it again.

[00:56:08]
Maybe. Yeah, Think about all the other stuff that you pointed out, all the checks that just go out. The NGO payments, the Social Security people. Think about just all that. Now apply that to the gold.

[00:56:19]
Absolutely. I just want to emphasize the sheer madness of the government. It's just because they have, like, magic money computers that the checks never bounce for the federal government. So you don't have the normal corrective mechanism that you'd have for a company or for an individual. The checks just always clear. The net result is inflation, which is effectively a tax on everyone. But the Defense Department hasn't pbutted an audit in I don't know how many years.

[00:56:48]
Seven years.

[00:56:49]
Yeah. I mean, exactly. So it's like you have to be friggin Chuck Norris. Only Chuck Norris could get the Defense Department to pbutt an audit, you know, type of thing. That's the level of skill you need, you know.

[00:57:01]
Well, that's what's so insane. If you bring it back to the idea that it's a business.

[00:57:04]
Well, yeah.

[00:57:05]
This should never be tolerated in any kind of functional business.

[00:57:08]
Exactly. So you know, you know, the Pentagon will like, like their accounting error. The stuff that they lose in the couch cushions is like 20, 30 billion dollars a year. They don't know where it went. It's gone. Where'd it go? And it's gone.

[00:57:30]
It's so insane.

[00:57:32]
It's insane.

[00:57:33]
It's so insane.

[00:57:34]
That's why I say even simple things like just requiring that outgoing payments for the treasury computer have a payment code and a comment of what the payment is about and someone to call about the payment, I think will have a very powerful effect in stopping wasteful outflows and stopping fraud.

[00:57:54]
Yeah. And here's another way to look at this. Imagine if there are people like you and the DOGE team out there in the world. Imagine if one of those works for an organization like USAID or any other organization and has this understanding of how much freakery is involved. But they have evil intentions and they're entwined in this system for decades and decades and they've built a career and all the entanglements that come with it and they start moving shoot around. You could probably do it easy. It sounds like the way you've laid it out. If you were a career person who's in there forever, who knew how everything works.

[00:58:34]
Yep.

[00:58:35]
And you were very clever. You could make some shoot happen and you could probably do it in conjunction with some people that you know that are forming an ngo. Hey, let's all work together.

[00:58:47]
Yeah.

[00:58:47]
Yeah. And this is the resistance that you're facing.

[00:58:51]
Yeah. I think it's the biggest scam of all time.

[00:58:54]
This is not something you ever like.

[00:58:56]
The biggest scam of all time ever.

[00:58:59]
Of human history.

[00:59:00]
Of human history is.

[00:59:02]
Wow. I think you're right.

[00:59:05]
Yeah. What else? A trillion dollar scam. There's never been a trillion dollar scam.

[00:59:13]
Now this is not something that you ever set out to do. This is not. You didn't have this as a career aspiration.

[00:59:20]
This is not like. This is the most absurd outcome I can possibly imagine, actually. Also, DOGE started as sort of a meme Coin. It was like a joke cryptocurrency involving memes and dogs.

[00:59:36]
Which is so funny that the letters wound up being perfect.

[00:59:39]
Yeah. Well, actually, I was originally going to quote, like, the Government Efficiency Commission, which is very boring name. And then people online were like, no, it needs to be the Department of Government Efficiency. And I was like, you know what? You're right.

[00:59:52]
Of course. Of course, of course. I mean, it's more evidence of the simulation.

[00:59:55]
Totally.

[00:59:56]
That.

[00:59:56]
That little, like, Shiba, like, our mascot is a. Is a cute dog.

[01:00:03]
It's a meme coin. The meme coin is probably worth a lot of money right now. Right. Like, every time I tweet about it probably shoots up.

[01:00:09]
Yeah.

[01:00:11]
The whole meme coin thing is bananas.

[01:00:14]
Yeah.

[01:00:14]
It is so bananas that people dump real money into these coins and then you could just pump up and sell.

[01:00:21]
Them like a casino or something. I don't know.

[01:00:23]
Yeah, it's totally.

[01:00:24]
People just do whatever the greater fool theory and musical chairs and whoever's like the last to sit down loses type of thing.

[01:00:30]
And somehow or another it's still legal.

[01:00:35]
I think not too many people. I mean, it's sort of like you go to the casino. If you expect to win at the casino, you're being a fool. Right. So I think if you expect to win at meme coins, you're being. Is not. Which you're being foolish. Yeah.

[01:00:51]
Yeah.

[01:00:51]
But you're not going to win a meme coins. It's like, it's. It's. But if. If you want, like, don't sink your life savings into a meme coin.

[01:00:58]
No, but you can gamble a little and you can ride waves and win a little and lose a little.

[01:01:04]
If you want to have some fun.

[01:01:05]
Yeah.

[01:01:05]
And don't come, then, you know, play, have play with me and coins.

[01:01:09]
But if you put your family. If you put your family's wealth on a meme coin in the Hawk 2.

[01:01:14]
The risk of saying something bold and outrageous. Don't bet the farm on a mean coin.

[01:01:20]
The weird one is the pump and dumps, like the people time all the time.

[01:01:25]
Yeah.

[01:01:25]
And people get shocked that somebody pump and dumped. Like, what is. What are you doing? Did you. Like, I was hoping to dump. I was hoping to make all the money out of this. I can't believe they got me, like.

[01:01:36]
Yeah.

[01:01:37]
It's just weird that it's legal still.

[01:01:42]
I mean, casinos illegal.

[01:01:43]
Yeah.

[01:01:43]
And it is like, just lose money at casinos.

[01:01:46]
Yeah. But you can't rig a casino like a pump and dump. You could rig a pump and Dump, you know?

[01:01:51]
Yeah, I guess. So.

[01:01:55]
Like, you could run a real pyramid scheme.

[01:01:58]
Well, I mean, the government's one big permit scheme, if you ask me.

[01:02:01]
Yeah, well, you can talk.

[01:02:03]
Social Security is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time. Right.

[01:02:07]
Explain that.

[01:02:08]
Oh, so. Well, people pay into Social Security and the money goes out of Social Security immediately. But the obligation for Social Security is your entire retirement career. So you're paying. You're paying. Like, if you look at the future obligations of Social Security, it far exceeds the tax revenue. Far. Have you ever looked at the debt clock?

[01:02:40]
Yes.

[01:02:41]
Okay, there's our present day debt, but then there's our future obligations. So when you look at the future obligations of Social Security, the actual national debt is like double what people think it is because of the future obligations. So basically, people are living way longer than expected and there are fewer babies being born. So you have more people who are retired and live for a long time and get retirement payments. So the future obligations. So however bad the financial situation is right now for the federal government, it will be much worse in the future. At the risk of being a buzzkill here.

[01:03:28]
Did you see?

[01:03:29]
So we better fix what we've got right now, because if it's bad now, it's gonna be much worse in the future.

[01:03:33]
There was an interview with this woman who was a whistleblower. Did we ever find out if that was true?

[01:03:37]
There's so many whistles being blown, it's hard to keep track.

[01:03:39]
A lot of whistles. This one lady. It was only in one state. It was very specific.

[01:03:44]
Instance.

[01:03:45]
Right, but it was using Social Security money. Correct? That was her. That was her allegation. So what she was alleging was that she was in charge of turning illegal immigrants into clients. That's what they would call them. And that she would go to them and try to ask them, do you have a headache? Do you have back problems? If you do now, you can be permanently disabled. You get permanent disability. So you get Social Security for life.

[01:04:10]
Yes. Not just Social Security, but disability, which is even more.

[01:04:13]
Right. And you get them on the taxpayer dole right away. And they're illegal aliens.

[01:04:18]
Yes. Oh. So if I were to say, like, what's at the heart of the sort of, like, why is the Democrat propaganda machine so fired up to destroy me? That's the main reason. The main reason is that entitlements fraud that includes, like, Social Security, disability, Medicaid, entitlements fraud for illegal aliens is what is serving as a gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here. Like, basically, if you pay people at a standard of living that is above 90% of Earth, then you have a very powerful incentive for 90% of Earth to come here and to stay here. But if you end the illegal alien fraud, then you turn off that magnet and they leave and they stop coming. And the ones that are here, many of them will simply leave. And if that happens, they will lose a mbuttive number of Democratic voters.

[01:05:33]
And if it didn't happen, they would turn those people into voters.

[01:05:36]
Correct.

[01:05:36]
Which they were trying to do.

[01:05:38]
They're already telling them so. In New York State, illegal aliens can already vote in state and city elections. A lot of people don't know that. I mean, they're trying to fight that. They're trying to stop that. But it's currently, I think it's like 600,000 are registered to vote illegal aliens in New York.

[01:05:58]
That is wild.

[01:05:59]
Yeah. Well, I mean, if you look at, say, you know, fema, the agency that was paying for illegal aliens to stay at luxury hotels in New York, was fema. That's an agency that's meant to support Americans in distress from natural disasters, was paying for luxury hotels for illegals in New York.

[01:06:27]
It's true. Yeah.

[01:06:29]
That's a fact.

[01:06:29]
Fact.

[01:06:30]
They literally, like, when we stopped that payment, we stopped all those monies because that's obviously an insane way to spend taxpayer money. New York sued the government, sued the federal government to get the money. So you could just look at their lawsuit. They were sending that money. Even after President Trump signed an executive order saying it needs to stop, they still Press send on $80 million to luxury hotels in New York. Your tax money went to pay for illegal aliens in luxury hotels in New York from an agency that is meant to help Americans in distress from natural disasters. Right.

[01:07:16]
And I would like to know how much. And I would like to know how much they spend on North Carolina and how much they spend on Maui.

[01:07:21]
Yes, exactly. What's actually happening is they're buying voters. That's really what's happening. It's like a giant voter fraud scam. They're importing voters, and it's really just a matter of time. A lot of people have trouble believing this, but the more you look at it, the more you will realize just how much of a problem this is and how it's not just real, it is an attempt to destroy democracy in America. That's what, in my view, is what it really is. If you take the sort of seven swing states, often the margin of victory there is like maybe 20,000 votes. If you put 200,000 illegals in there and they have like a 80% likelihood of voting down and it's only a matter of time before they become citizens, then those swing states will not be swing states in the future. And if they are not swing states, we'll be a permanent one party state country, permanent deep blue socialist state. That's what America will become.

[01:08:36]
And that was the game plan.

[01:08:38]
That was the game plan. That is still the game plan. And they almost succeeded. If the machine of which the Kamala puppet was the representation had won, that's what would have happened. The reason I went so hardcore for Trump was because to me this was a fork in the road. Like a very obvious fork in the road. If they had another four years, they would legalize enough illegals in the swing states to make the swing states not swing states. They would just, they would be blue states. Then they would win the presidential, they'd win the House, the Senate and the Presidency. They would then make D.C. into a state, maybe Puerto Rico, get four extra senators, pack the Supreme Court. So then you'll have the House, Judiciary, Senate and presidency all blue. And then they will keep importing more illegals to cement that outcome. Basically what happened in California.

[01:09:53]
Jesus Christ.

[01:09:54]
It would have been the end. That's why I went so hardcore for Trump. It was otherwise been the end. And that's why the Democrat machine is so intent on destroying me.

[01:10:09]
It's just so fascinating that people can't see this.

[01:10:13]
I mean, I invite people to do their research. The more they do their research, the more they will see that what I'm saying is absolutely true. It's like, just do the research.

[01:10:24]
Yeah. It's such a bad idea, even for the Democrats, which is what they don't understand. Like, it's the same people.

[01:10:32]
It's not ultimately going to work out.

[01:10:33]
No, it's the same people.

[01:10:35]
Yes.

[01:10:35]
It's just they're doing it under the guise that they're the kind, compbuttionate, progressive people.

[01:10:41]
Yes.

[01:10:42]
But the same outcome takes place. It's just about control. They probably institute some central bank, digital currency and some social credit score system.

[01:10:51]
And censorship, of course.

[01:10:52]
Yeah, of course. Well, that was the big fear coming into this election, was that if they can't censor things like we talked about it before, but there was two major forks in the road. The big one was Trump didn't get shot. The other big one was you by Twitter. And if those two things don't happen, the whole world looks different.

[01:11:12]
Yes.

[01:11:13]
Yeah.

[01:11:13]
We don't Want to be on that timeline.

[01:11:15]
Now we don't want to have only one side represented because guess what? They will hijack that side. Whatever it is, they will hijack that side and use it for money and control. And that's what it's all about. It's not about good people versus bad people. It's a bullshoot shell game.

[01:11:29]
Yeah, I mean, I think these things are actually, it's easy to understand if you look at basic incentives. The basic incentive here is the more illegals that the Democrats can bring in, the more likely they are to win. So that's what they're going to do. That's what they have been doing. And it worked in California. California, super majority them. And look at all the companies that are leaving California. Yeah, I mean, in n out just announced they're leaving their headquarters. Leaving California.

[01:12:00]
They're moving to Tennessee. Yeah, yeah.

[01:12:02]
So. And California made healthcare free for illegals as of last year. So. And that obviously that's a gigantic magnet for more illegals. And, and this is not a thing you can solve simply with money because what happens is you simply have more patients than a doctor can possibly see. And you can't just make doctors out of nothing. So sometimes people are like, oh, it's just a money thing. No, it takes a long time for somebody to become a doctor. 30 years. And so what actually happens in California is that, that there are too many patients for the doctors to see. So then the average citizen in California suffers as a result. Now the elite in California are fine because they have private doctors. They can just pay for the best doctors. So the elite in California are doing fine, but your average citizen in California is not doing fine. And the tax burden for health care for illegals was supposed to be 3 billion. I think they now estimate it's 9 billion. But that number will scale to infinity. Basically. It's like, why not? Why not? If you need any operation at all, come to California and have it be free.

[01:13:26]
Right from anywhere on earth.

[01:13:28]
And the people that want to look at it in the most charitable way, they say, oh, well, these people are hard working, good people and they're the backbone of our city and they should have access to all the things that we have access to. And I just don't think they understand that it's a political pawn. I don't think they understand it's a political game. This is not done for compbuttion and kindness.

[01:13:49]
No.

[01:13:49]
This is just done to ensure that it stays blue.

[01:13:52]
Correct.

[01:13:53]
And it's essentially a bribery with your tax dollars.

[01:13:56]
Yes. This is why the Dems will not even deport criminals.

[01:14:04]
Yeah.

[01:14:06]
Because every criminal deported is a lost vote. So even if somebody is illegal with a criminal record and commits crime in America, they are still were not being deported.

[01:14:20]
And then on top of that, California made it actually illegal to ask for ID when people vote.

[01:14:26]
Yes. California and New York, you are not allowed to show your ID when you vote. I just want to be clear so everyone understands this. In California, New York, you are not allowed to show your ID even if you want to.

[01:14:39]
Right. Why would that ever be a good idea?

[01:14:45]
I mean, if you wanted to. If you're trying to do. If you're trying to facilitate fraud in elections, it's a great idea.

[01:14:52]
That's the only reason?

[01:14:53]
Yes.

[01:14:54]
There's no other reason logically why that would be a good idea.

[01:14:57]
It's for fraud. It's like, wake up, sheeple.

[01:15:02]
Wake up.

[01:15:03]
Hello. Like, let's say you wanted to commit forward. What are the things you would do?

[01:15:07]
Yeah.

[01:15:07]
You would say you don't need ID and you can mail in your ballot.

[01:15:11]
And we'll give you free health care.

[01:15:12]
Yes.

[01:15:13]
Stay here. Yes, stay here. I know it's on fire, but stay here.

[01:15:17]
I mean, in this case, it being on fire is not just a metaphor in California. Okay. It's just like, goddamn entire neighborhood's burning down.

[01:15:26]
It's just once they allowed people to vote that are not legal in California. Once you. If you're. If you're gonna do that, it's. It's over.

[01:15:37]
Exactly. There's. There's no coming back from that.

[01:15:40]
The numbers are just. No. People are so indoctrinated, too. There's so many people that no matter what they think voting Republican means you're an butthole.

[01:15:48]
Yes.

[01:15:48]
And they won't do it. They won't do it. They. They'll put their freaking rainbow flag on their porch and they'll just ride it right into the beach.

[01:15:55]
Civilizational suicide.

[01:15:56]
Yeah. Right to the rocks. Bang, crash the boat.

[01:15:59]
I mean, there's a guy who posts on X who's great. Godside.

[01:16:05]
Yeah. He's a friend of mine. He's been on the podcast a bunch of times.

[01:16:07]
Yeah, he's awesome.

[01:16:08]
Yeah, it's great.

[01:16:09]
And he talks about, you know, basically suicidal empathy. Mm. Like, if there's, like, there's so much empathy that you actually suicide yourself.

[01:16:19]
Yeah.

[01:16:21]
So that we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on. And it's like, I believe in empathy. Like, I think you should care about other people, but you need to have empathy for civilization as a Whole and not commit to a civilizational suicide.

[01:16:34]
Also, don't let someone use your empathy against you so they can completely control your state and then do an insanely bad job of managing it and never get removed.

[01:16:45]
The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy. The empathy exploit. They're exploiting a bug in Western civilization, which is the empathy response. And I think empathy is good, but you need to think it through and not just be programmed like a robot.

[01:17:10]
Right. Understand when empathy has been actually used as a tool.

[01:17:14]
Yes. Like it's weaponized. Empathy is the issue. Yeah, weaponized empathy. And. Yeah.

[01:17:23]
And it's also the rigid adherence to that liberal ideology. Like, you can't switch sides over there. Like California. If you're a part of that whole tech, Hollywood, entertainment, any of those circles, you're on the left, like, almost holy. Almost completely.

[01:17:42]
It's borderline illegal to be a Republican in California. In San Francisco or la, it's borderline illegal to be a Republican.

[01:17:50]
You're certainly shunned.

[01:17:52]
No, look, I mean, in, like, San Francisco, you could shoot heroin while taking a dump on the mayor's car in front of city Hall. Okay. And nothing would happen to you. But if you walk down the street with a MAGA hat, you're gonna get attacked. It's insane.

[01:18:11]
Yeah, it's insane. It's also so Orwellian that a hat that says Make America great again would cause people to have a violent reaction. Like, aren't you American? Wouldn't just. Just as a whole, like the saying, wouldn't that be a good thing for everyone? Make America great again. But because it's attached to Donald Trump and that red hat, you'll get maced for wearing that red hat. They will make America worse by beating you. So it's like, it's an evil thing. They're doing a violent buttault in America because you want to make America great again. I mean, it's like a scene in a book. It doesn't seem like it could be that ridiculous. Like, remember when all lives matter would get you fired?

[01:19:00]
Which is insane.

[01:19:01]
Insane people got fired because they said all lives matter, which is a very.

[01:19:06]
Reasonable thing to say.

[01:19:07]
How reasonable is that? Yes, that's essentially saying everybody matters.

[01:19:12]
But that's literally all you're saying.

[01:19:14]
That's not what you were supposed to say. You had to say black lives matter, which of course they do. If you say all lives matter, everybody matters. Yes, but the idea of being a colorblind society was completely abandoned somewhere around 2012ish.

[01:19:28]
Yeah, I mean, I sort of can trace it to. When did the gun emoji get nerfed? When did it turn into a squirt gun?

[01:19:35]
That was a couple of years ago.

[01:19:36]
It was like, 2016, I think.

[01:19:38]
Was it? Yeah, yeah, it became a squirt gun. Can you bring it back to X?

[01:19:43]
Yeah, no, no. Right now, if you use a gun emoji on X, Apple will insist that it'd be a squirt gun, and then the X app turns it back into a gun. 1911.

[01:19:56]
Oh, really?

[01:19:57]
Yeah.

[01:19:58]
Oh, that's great.

[01:19:58]
So you can. You can actually, you know, have a 1911 gun. We reverted the Apple change inside the app.

[01:20:08]
Oh, that's hilarious. That's hilarious that it's that thing. So offensive. The gun and then the pregnant man. Both of those got me, you motherfreakers.

[01:20:19]
I mean, I like that meme where it's like the people telling you that what you're hearing is disinformation are the same people that did the pregnant man emoji.

[01:20:27]
Yes. Yeah.

[01:20:28]
Think about that.

[01:20:30]
Well, also, the same people that say a woman attacked a Tesla factory. Yeah, the woman.

[01:20:37]
It's a dude.

[01:20:37]
It's a dude. Like, really obvious dude. Really?

[01:20:42]
Mentally ill dude.

[01:20:43]
Yeah, Mentally ill dude with a wig on. Say that.

[01:20:45]
Yes.

[01:20:46]
Yeah, but NBC.

[01:20:51]
Yo, this has got a. This is a dude with a strong jawline.

[01:20:55]
Yeah.

[01:20:55]
Okay.

[01:20:55]
He's wearing woman face.

[01:20:59]
It's a buff dude.

[01:21:00]
Yeah, it's a buff dude wearing woman face.

[01:21:03]
I mean, come on.

[01:21:04]
That's not. That's not a woman.

[01:21:05]
Yeah. And they're like, saying, watch out for disinformation. I'm like, what are you talking about?

[01:21:11]
So crazy.

[01:21:11]
This is bullshoot.

[01:21:12]
I mean, it's just more evidence of the virus, though, right? Like, it killed objectivity, killed reality, and it demanded strict adherence or you were attacked. Yeah, yeah.

[01:21:25]
Any questioning of it would result in being ostracized.

[01:21:29]
Do you. What kind of responsibility do you feel like knowing that if you didn't take over Twitter and turn it into X, if that didn't happen, I really think the world's a very different place right now. Like, how long have you owned it for?

[01:21:46]
Two couple years, basically.

[01:21:48]
Imagine a couple years of it being run the way it was run before and probably accelerating.

[01:21:54]
I mean, my account would have been suspended long ago. For sure.

[01:21:58]
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Just for the disinformation.

[01:22:02]
Yeah, it would have been.

[01:22:05]
Trump would have never come back. Alex Jones would have definitely never been back.

[01:22:09]
Definitely not.

[01:22:09]
No.

[01:22:10]
No. So, yeah.

[01:22:16]
Does that weigh on you? Like, I would feel like that would be A freaking heavy responsibility.

[01:22:22]
Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying to keep civilization going here, you know, for longer. So I think we at least want to build a city on Mars and become a multi planet civilization, which I think would be incredibly important in ensuring the long term survival of civilization.

[01:22:53]
Are you still rescuing those people that are stuck in the space station?

[01:22:56]
Yeah, that's coming up in a couple weeks, I think.

[01:22:58]
Whoa. They've been up there for how long, Jamie? They were supposed to be there for a couple days, right?

[01:23:03]
I think actually probably four weeks. They're supposed to be there. They're supposed to be up there for like eight days.

[01:23:08]
Yeah.

[01:23:08]
And they've been up there for like eight months, so a little longer than expected.

[01:23:13]
freak.

[01:23:14]
Yeah.

[01:23:15]
What is it gonna be like for those people when they get back? They're gonna be a wreck for a long time, right?

[01:23:18]
Yeah. If longer you stay up there, you get, you know, sort of in zero g. You get increased bone loss. So it ended up being like this political football and sort of, sort of hotly contested topic. We offered to bring them back early. This offer was rejected by the Biden administration.

[01:23:39]
Why?

[01:23:40]
For political reasons.

[01:23:41]
That's so crazy.

[01:23:42]
I mean, there's no way that they're gonna make anyone who's supporting Trump look, look good. Wow.

[01:23:49]
What do you think they would have done if they had won? Well, how'd they get those people back?

[01:23:55]
No, they can only get them back with, with a SpaceX spacecraft. But they pushed the return date past the inauguration date.

[01:24:02]
Wow. Yeah, so they would have let you do it. But after the. Wow. And so it would have been them authorizing.

[01:24:13]
There isn't anyone else to do it.

[01:24:16]
NASA can't get them.

[01:24:19]
Only the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is the only one that is considered safe enough to bring them back. So NASA concluded that the Boeing spacecraft was not safe. So that's why they're stuck there.

[01:24:31]
Holy shoot.

[01:24:33]
Yeah.

[01:24:33]
And you can't ask Russia to help.

[01:24:35]
That would be awkward.

[01:24:36]
A little bit.

[01:24:37]
Yeah.

[01:24:37]
Yeah. Be a nice thing if they did. They said, guys, we'll help.

[01:24:41]
I think that for enough money they would.

[01:24:44]
You think so?

[01:24:45]
Yeah, but they would, they would obviously treat it as a propaganda victory and charge crazy money.

[01:24:53]
It's just disgusting that they would use that as a political tool.

[01:24:57]
Yeah, yeah. So. Well, they were also. The Biden administration was also suing SpaceX. They had this mbuttive lawsuit against SpaceX for SpaceX not hiring Asylum seekers.

[01:25:13]
Right.

[01:25:13]
So people like, say, like, oh, Elon's making it up. This Biden administration wasn't against SpaceX. I'm like, Bro, the Department of justice had a mbuttive lawsuit against SpaceX for not hiring asylum seekers, even though it is illegal for us to hire anyone who is not a permanent resident. So it is both. There's a law that says you have to hire asylum seekers, but there's also a law that says anyone hired by a rocket company, which is an advanced weapons technology, must be a permanent resident. An asylum seeker is not a permanent resident. So it is both legal and illegal to hire asylum seekers. So why would the Biden administration launch a mbuttive lawsuit? Again, this is public information. It's not like my imagination. Why would they launch such a mbuttive lawsuit against SpaceX? They're extremely antagonistic.

[01:26:12]
It just doesn't make any sense that that could ever even get past the first day of someone looking at it. If it's both illegal and you're trying to enforce it, like you can't enforce it. Yes, this is an advanced weapons company. This is crazy.

[01:26:27]
Yes.

[01:26:27]
It should be like this. Throw this out.

[01:26:29]
There's, in fact, there's like international traffic in arms regulations, is like a law that is there to ensure that if only permanent residents of the United States can work at advanced weapons companies, Rockets are advanced weapons. So the same is true of if it's like nuclear or some bioweapon thing or something like that. Obviously, if someone were to work its basics and then go leave and go to North Korea or Iran, they could build missile technology that could, you know, destroy the United States. That's why you're not allowed to hire people who are permanent residents. It's logical.

[01:27:13]
Logical. So is that lawsuit still pending?

[01:27:17]
It was just dismissed.

[01:27:20]
How long was it going on for?

[01:27:21]
A couple years.

[01:27:22]
Holy shoot.

[01:27:24]
Yeah.

[01:27:26]
That's the other thing that drives me crazy like that. People don't understand that if you sanction lawfare like that, if you sanction attacking your political enemies, someone's going to do that to you. Like, if the wrong people get in office, if new people get in, four years from now, eight years from now, who knows who it's going to be? You've already set a precedent. You've already attacked someone, charged them with 34 felonies where they're really just misdemeanors and they're also past the statute of limitation. And now you're talking all over the news that this is a convicted felon, convicted felon. They kept saying convicted felon, convicted felon, and everybody knows what it is. Yes, it's terrifying. It's terrifying. They could do it. So Brazenly, to a guy who was the president for four years.

[01:28:14]
Right. That lawsuit was funded by Reid Hoffman, who is a major Dem donor and also an Epstein client. The plot thickens.

[01:28:28]
The plot thickens. Jesus Christ.

[01:28:30]
Yes.

[01:28:33]
It'S just. It's so blatant. It's like, so obvious. The SpaceX lawsuit, the Trump stuff, it's just. It's so obvious.

[01:28:42]
Yes. Like, known Epstein clients who are obviously extremely powerful. The powerful politically and very wealthy are Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and Reid Hoffman and some others, too, but those three. So why was Reid Hoffman so intent on destroying Trump?

[01:29:11]
Do you think it's because they're worried about the list coming out?

[01:29:14]
Yeah, one of the reasons. Yeah. So, I mean, I'm like, this is, you know. Yeah.

[01:29:24]
So it's so frustrating to be sitting in a situation where the list isn't coming out.

[01:29:29]
Well, it better come out. I mean, hopefully tomorrow.

[01:29:32]
Well, I mean, why'd they release bullshoot today?

[01:29:34]
I don't know.

[01:29:35]
What's the point in giving these people, like, a happy folder to wave around in front of the camera with nothing in it? That's new. It doesn't make any sense. It's not encouraging.

[01:29:47]
Like I said, it's. The tough thing that they've got is, you know, they've been made captain of a ship with a hostile crew.

[01:29:53]
Right.

[01:29:54]
So they don't have, like. It's not like you. You have, like, magical powers. You get made captain of a triple the hostile crew, you still have a hostile crew. Right. You've got to bring in people who are going to, you know, be helpful as opposed to obstructionist.

[01:30:13]
Right.

[01:30:16]
So. But yeah, I think the public will be rightly frustrated if there is. If no one is prosecuted for the Epstein client list. No one at all. Which, you know, like, is it, you know, like, at least, I don't know, the top five or something, like some number. Should. There should at least be an attempted prosecution of the worst offenders.

[01:30:46]
Well, particularly if Ghislaine Maxwell is in jail for cool trafficking.

[01:30:50]
Yes.

[01:30:51]
Because, like. Well, trafficking.

[01:30:52]
That means cool trafficking occurred.

[01:30:54]
Right. So she was in. She's in jail for it.

[01:30:56]
Yes. So who are the clients?

[01:30:59]
Yeah, yeah. How do you put someone in jail and you don't even name the clients? That sounds kind of insane, I think.

[01:31:07]
Yes, it would. Yes.

[01:31:10]
Because stunning that they've been able to hold it back for so long. It's really kind of amazing, like when people say that people can't keep secrets. What the freak are you talking about? Look at this.

[01:31:22]
Yeah. I mean, a bunch of These things are not like it's common knowledge, but we just, we don't actually have the proof.

[01:31:29]
Right.

[01:31:30]
So the proof is there. I mean, there's lots of videos. Yeah, there's lots. I mean, the dude is like a mountain of like, whenever they raided Epstein's place, there would have been like a mountain of evidence. Where is that mountain?

[01:31:48]
Right. What'd you do with it?

[01:31:49]
Yeah, like who took possession of the evidence? Yeah, specifically.

[01:31:53]
Right.

[01:31:54]
The individuals.

[01:31:55]
Where are the tapes?

[01:31:56]
Yes.

[01:31:56]
How many levels of clearance do I have to get to get into the vault?

[01:32:00]
Yeah, well.

[01:32:06]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:32:10]
You know what we need are people who are really good with computers. Oh yeah, really good with.

[01:32:16]
Was this technology.

[01:32:17]
I remember seeing this photo.

[01:32:19]
That's when they raided his home.

[01:32:20]
They were.

[01:32:21]
That's on the island. They were there then. Yeah. They got everything, I'm sure.

[01:32:26]
I mean, there must have been so much stuff on that island.

[01:32:28]
There must have been. And if it wasn't there, where was it?

[01:32:31]
Yeah.

[01:32:32]
What? You know, it has to be uploaded somewhere. There has to be some sort of a chain of evidence. Yeah, a chain of custody.

[01:32:38]
It's got to be a mountain of evidence.

[01:32:40]
Yeah. The other thing they're going to Talk about is UAPs. They're going to release all the UAP information. So you're the guy to ask about this. What, what, if any possibility is there that there is some sort of advanced propulsion system technology that's being worked on in secret and that they're trying to cover this up with this talk of aliens and alien tech and not of this world? And is it possible that there's some sort of very secret program that's going on in cahoots with some defense contractors that are developing advanced propulsion systems that they're using for these drones?

[01:33:27]
I mean, SpaceX, you know, my company, SpaceX has the most advanced rocket technology in the world. I think I'd know.

[01:33:37]
Right.

[01:33:40]
And I. The best of my knowledge, there is not any magic. There's. There's not like some super advanced propulsion technology.

[01:33:47]
There have been people who have theorized different gravity drives and different things. Is there anything that's ever gotten past the theoretical stage? No, nothing.

[01:33:58]
Well, there's nothing even that I'm aware of that works in theory.

[01:34:02]
Mmm.

[01:34:04]
It's not like I would like this to exist. To be clear. I would like this to exist and I have the. From a security clearance standpoint, I have top, top secret. There is. I have equivalent of like an all access pbutt from a security clearance standpoint. So I don't think they're hiding it from me basically. I don't think they, they could unless.

[01:34:32]
It'S completely in these weapons manufacturing corporations.

[01:34:37]
I mean, I know these weapons manufacturing companies like Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, I mean yeah, they do some interesting things, but they do not have, there's no breakthrough that they have. So I'm confident they do not have a breakthrough. When you hear people like why don't they just compete with SpaceX and make a better rocket? In which case, you know, right, they can make. Why are they holding back on making a lot of money from beating SpaceX with better rockets?

[01:35:04]
My thought was that what if it's just a drone and you can't have a biological entity inside of it because it just bursts from the freaking speed that it's moving at, that a human couldn't tolerate the amount of force. So they're just drones?

[01:35:22]
I don't think so.

[01:35:23]
So what do you think? People like Ryan Grave, Commander David I.

[01:35:26]
Want cool things to exist, right? Like say, like do I want UFOs to exist? Yes, I want UFOs to exist. Because that would be really interesting.

[01:35:34]
Everybody does.

[01:35:35]
Yeah, it'll be cool. It's a more boring world where UFOs don't exist or like flying, like advanced propulsion stuff doesn't exist. That's. If it doesn't exist, that's more boring. I'd like, it'd be more interesting if it did exist. I'd like it to exist. I hope we find something, but I have not seen SpaceX launches 90% of all satellite mbutt to orbit. So if you take all of Earth's rocket launches, my company has a 90% market share of Earth, China does about 5%, and the rest of the world is including the Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and everyone does 5%. So why, why wouldn't they use this to defeat SpaceX?

[01:36:32]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:36:36]
Why would they hold.

[01:36:36]
No, listen, that's why I asked you. It would make sense. What do you think these people are saying?

[01:36:42]
A rocket every two days.

[01:36:43]
But what do you think these people are seeing when, when you have reliable people like Commander David Fravor, who had that infamous tick tock tic Tac experience off the coast of San Diego where they got this thing on video. They tracked it going 50,000ft above sea level to 50ft in like a second. Okay, yeah, yeah. And then they also have video evidence of this thing accelerating at a great speed. Eyewitness accounts from two different jets.

[01:37:11]
Sure. I mean, can we, does anyone have a high res video or photo of this thing?

[01:37:19]
Well, there's a Video of this thing where they're locked onto it and then it takes off. It shoots off the frame. No, it's like whatever the systems they use on fighter jets in 2004, essentially like Windows 95.

[01:37:32]
I mean there's like somebody did a curve of like the resolution of UFOs and the resolution of cameras. UFO resolution has stayed flat despite megapixels and cameras going like, you know, super high.

[01:37:45]
Well, according to Christopher Melon.

[01:37:47]
Why are they still blurry?

[01:37:48]
Christopher Mellon who worked in the State Department said that they have high resolution photos and videos of these things. And that's all that. He's seen it. It's all locked away. Whenever people say that to me, I'm like, don't even tell me that. Then don't.

[01:38:00]
Unless you have just leak it, for God's sake.

[01:38:02]
Put it out there. Yeah, like let it slip.

[01:38:05]
Yes.

[01:38:05]
Yeah. I mean there's a couple photos, they're grainy. There's not one thing that I've ever looked at and go, holy freak. That's it. That's what I'm looking for.

[01:38:14]
Ask our grok AI right now to create a high res image of an alien spacecraft, you know, over Austin.

[01:38:23]
Yeah.

[01:38:23]
And it's gonna do a great job. So why would we not have at least that, right?

[01:38:31]
Yeah, but I want to believe. That's the problem. My brain starts going, oh, come on, this is no fun. I want it to be real. I want there to be at least be some advanced propulsion system. If not, like what are all these people seeing? Like what is happening if we're not being occasionally visited by things that are smart enough to hide?

[01:38:50]
We might be. I just said these aliens are very subtle.

[01:38:52]
Yeah, you keep saying that. It's a good line. I mean it's a solid line because it's pretty accurate.

[01:38:59]
I just want to see some high res video of aliens.

[01:39:01]
Okay. How are they just evading all the cameras, if you think about that. And the ones that you do get them on, it's just like some far away light that's moving weird. And it could be a lot of things, but I want to believe.

[01:39:14]
Yeah, I mean, I mean there have been like multiple times where, you know, the Air Force or Navy is has called SpaceX and said they think they've seen aliens. And we're like, was it at this time on this date in this location? They're like, yes. How do you know that's us?

[01:39:32]
There's been a lot of that.

[01:39:33]
That's our satellites. Those are our satellites. They're like no, they're not. I'm like, yeah, they're definitely our satellites.

[01:39:38]
Oh, yeah, people see the SpaceX satellites all the time whizzing by.

[01:39:41]
Yeah, they're our satellites and they are moving at 16,000 miles an hour. It's pretty fast.

[01:39:50]
And there's also stuff that the United States government does have that gets mistaken for UFOs. Remember the first time I saw a stealth bomber, we were filming Fear Factor was like right after 2003, like right after the, the war had broken off and they were flying a stealth bomber down in Palmdale. I was like, holy shoot. Like, if I didn't know what that was, I would 100% think that's from another world. freaking cool. Yeah, really cool. I mean, it doesn't look like a humans. It looks like something from Battlestar Galactica, you know?

[01:40:23]
It does look. Yeah, it does look awesome. I mean, they're not stealthy against any advanced radar system, by the way. That doesn't work.

[01:40:31]
It doesn't work anymore. Was it old school stuff?

[01:40:34]
They're only, they're only stealthy against old radars.

[01:40:38]
Oh, okay.

[01:40:40]
I mean, you can still see them. Like, they're not invisible, right? They're not like, oh, it's not like, you know, cloaking device from Star Trek.

[01:40:50]
Did you see when me and Lex, we, we watched the, the rocket get caught live while it was happening? That to me was one of the. To see it actually, I've seen videos of it happen, but to see it actually live, right, was one of the coolest freaking things. Like, wow, we are in the future, right?

[01:41:12]
I mean, nobody else can do that.

[01:41:15]
Yeah, it's true. Nobody else could do that. That's fact. Yeah, it's pretty wild.

[01:41:22]
It's because I'm an alien. What's this time you. I'm an alien. And I keep trying telling people I'm an alien, but they don't believe me.

[01:41:29]
I believe you.

[01:41:29]
Okay, thank you.

[01:41:30]
I believe you. That's my business. My suspicion all along was that you.

[01:41:34]
Were trying to get back to my home planet.

[01:41:36]
You're a friendly alien. Like, it's nothing wrong with aliens. I like people from everywhere.

[01:41:40]
Yeah.

[01:41:40]
Even other planets. What's next? Like, now that you can do that, you can catch rockets. What's like the ultimate expression of rocket technology? Like what, what comes after this?

[01:41:54]
Well, I mean, the fundamental breakthrough we're aiming for at SpaceX is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital rocket where both stages are fully and rapidly reusable. With our Falcon rocket, we are able to reuse the main stage and the nose cone, but we're not able to reuse the upper stage. And it still takes us at least a few days from when the main stage lands to when we can fly it again. So it's not fully reusable because we lose the upper stage, which costs $10 million to build. And, and then the main stage, it's not as reusable as like an aircraft. You can't just refuel it and fly it. Requires work for a couple days. But the starship design is the first design that is capable of full and rapid reusability, where that is one of the possible outcomes. And once you have full and rapid reusability, the cost of access to space drops by a factor of 100. It's like 100 times cheaper by some metrics. It's 1,000 times cheaper. And then when you factor in orbital refilling, so your refill on orbit, it can drop the cost of going cost per ton to the surface of Mars by a factor of 10,000.

[01:43:35]
Whoa.

[01:43:36]
Yeah.

[01:43:37]
So what has to improve in order to make it reusable?

[01:43:45]
Well, there's some like, we're pretty close to being able to rapidly reuse the booster for starship. That's why, you know, it comes back and gets caught by the arms, and then the arms place it back in the launch mount. So now this all, you know, we have a little bit of engine damage, we got a little bit of heat shield damage. There's like, there's like tweaks that are needed. But we're pretty close to achieving full and rapid reusability of the booster, the ship. I mean, I think we'll achieve reusability of the ship this year. And I think we'll achieve rapid reusability of the whole stack ship and booster next year. This is the fundamental breakthrough required for life to become multi planetary.

[01:44:51]
And what needs to improve in order to make it reusable? What's wrong with it right now?

[01:44:58]
On the shift side, the toughest problem is the heat shield. So no one has ever developed a fully reusable orbital heat shield because when you come in from orbital velocity, you come in like a flaming meteor, like you're just a raging ball of fire. And it's hard to have a heat shield that doesn't partially melt or get destroyed in that process. You know, that wasn't a problem we were able to solve with Falcon 9. That's why the alpha stage burns up on reentry with starship, the ship portion, you got the booster and you got the ship. We've got to solve the making a fully reusable orbital heat shield. A problem that has never been solved before. For a while there, I was like, I'm not sure this is solvable at this point. I think it is solvable. It requires detailed iteration on the heat shield tiles. We've vertically integrated the manufacturing of the heat shield tiles because there was no supplier that could provide us with the materials that were needed. So the. You need to make essentially this very fine vermicelli of glbutt and aluminum oxide fibers. Aluminum oxide is basically sapphire. So it's like glbutt and sapphire, very fine fibers in exactly the right geometry with special coatings in order to have the heat shield tile be reusable.

[01:46:54]
Like, not melt, but not be so brittle that it gets damaged ascent or descent. Like, it can't be as, you know, it's kind of like almost the brittleness of a coffee cup type of thing. And the rocket's shaking like hell. So you got this thing like you saw it firsthand. Like, imagine you're at ground zero of that rocket. Like, you feel how much shaking it was when you're like five miles away. Imagine if you're right there, you know, so you got. You're shaking these things that are like, as brittle as a coffee cup, trying not to have them crack or break and then not have them melt. You've got several thousand of these things, and if even a few of them break, it's not reusable.

[01:47:43]
So is there innovation that's being done in the materials technology at SpaceX, where you're constantly trying to find and tweak a better version of this?

[01:47:52]
Yes, that's a very difficult problem. It's a problem no one has ever solved. So we've got to get the exact right materials, combination the right molecules in the right shape, and then apply that heat shield perfectly to the rocket with no mistakes. There's a reason that no one solved this before. It's a very difficult problem. So like I said, we had to vertically integrate the entire manufacturing of the tile from basic raw materials to a finished tile. Like, build the entire supply chain from basic raw materials. So you're just inputting silicon and aluminum oxides.

[01:48:44]
And what is the difference between the way you guys do it versus the way they used to do it for the space shuttle?

[01:48:53]
Well, I mean, the space shuttle, like space shuttle Leading Edge, used like, quite dense carbon carbon tiles. Like it was. They're like, basically thick and heavy, but also subject to cracking. That's like, what happens. The foam broke off and it hit the tile. Cracked the tile. Then on entry, the tiles that have been cracked or broken weren't able to shield the shuttle. And so the plasma got in and melted the primary structure. And the whole space shuttle broke apart.

[01:49:33]
Yeah.

[01:49:34]
So you basically can't have something that's as brittle, you know, brittle like the space shuttle.

[01:49:41]
There's footage of that, right? Yeah.

[01:49:45]
And rained debris over the whole United States. And they got almost all the pieces. The full technical explanation would, I think, be understood by about six people listening to this. There was a lot of brilliant engineering. The space shuttle tiles. And a bunch of. The heat shielding wasn't even tiles. It was actually silica blankets, like, you know, felt blankets, essentially. If you look closely, you'll see it actually is. They're actually heat blankets, not tiles in some areas. But they would have cracked tiles and they would have. Occasionally the tiles would fall off. There were a few close calls where tiles fell off, but they weren't in a super vulnerable position on the space shuttle. But it would take them several months, like eight, nine months to refurbish a space shuttle between each flight. So it was not reusable, really, and it certainly wasn't rapid. So like I said, a very hard problem you've got to have. You've also got to sort of attach the tiles in a way that enables the structure underneath to move, to expand and contract, even though you've got these very rigid tiles. So like the main. The tanks which take on cryogenic propellant will contract when you put in the cryogenic propellant.

[01:51:30]
But then when you come in and you get very hot, they will expand. So now you're expanding, you're contracting and expanding the gap between these rigid tiles.

[01:51:40]
For how much.

[01:51:44]
It varies depending on where you are on the vehicle. So if you're in the cryogenic tank section, I mean, you can see like a 10, 20% difference in the gap.

[01:51:59]
Really.

[01:52:00]
It's pretty significant. Yeah. It's enough that you can't just put all the tile. You can't just jam the tiles together. If you put them. If you actually butted them up, they would all crack because there's too much movement. There's also some amount of body bending. So as the ship is like ascending, you know, when the engines steer, there's a little bit of movement. So if the tiles are too close together, they'll essentially just crack and snap. You have to have a gap.

[01:52:31]
Like how planes.

[01:52:32]
Yeah, like plane wing will move.

[01:52:34]
Yeah.

[01:52:34]
Plane body will move too.

[01:52:37]
Wow.

[01:52:38]
You have to have some gap. But if you have too much of a gap. Then the heat gets, gets to the, you know, gets past the tile and melts the strut, the structure.

[01:52:50]
Holy shoot.

[01:52:51]
It's a hard problem.

[01:52:53]
And how large are these tiles?

[01:52:55]
I mean, they're like that big.

[01:52:57]
That's it.

[01:52:58]
Well, they're not all exactly the same size, but yeah, we're sort of a hexagonal tile.

[01:53:03]
And they have to essentially be. You can't like 3D print the whole thing. You can't have one structure. It has to be tiles because it has to have that ability to move.

[01:53:13]
Well, there's no 3D printer that's. I mean, the biggest ones are like maybe three feet. You know, there's no. You can't 3D print it. Nor would you. You have to have something that can move.

[01:53:28]
Right.

[01:53:28]
It has to be able to flex like so you got expansion and contraction. You really drive like you're. You're putting in liquid oxygen, which is like minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Actually we subcool it to minus 330 degrees Fahrenheit. So it's very cold. And then it will be several hundred degrees, maybe 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, potentially in went on re entry. So you get this huge temperature swing. So the thermal expansion is substantial and the whole. And you've got thermal expansion and contraction combined with body bending. So you have to take the worst case body bending and thermal expansion contraction. This is a very hard problem.

[01:54:22]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:54:24]
Delicate balance.

[01:54:25]
But you're confident that you guys are.

[01:54:26]
Going to be able to crack it at this point? I'm confident that it is solvable.

[01:54:32]
It just needs a certain amount of versions of it. That's why when these things blow up, you're like, yeah, we expect them to blow up.

[01:54:39]
Yeah. What would be really helpful is for us to get the ship back so we can study where we had cracked tiles or lost tiles. Why did we, you know, why did we have a cracked or lost tiles was because maybe the tiles were. The gap was too big, too small. Maybe there was a height difference between the tiles. Maybe we need to change the chemical composition. You know, there's. We just want. If we can get the damn ship back intact, we can. We can iterate a lot better, which. We'll get it back intact. So I think we'll get it back intact this year. But that's why I think we'll probably recover the ship sometime this year and then we might be able to re fly one. But probably with a fair bit of work by the end of this year. But it's going to take us many iterations before we can achieve rapid reusability where the ship comes back, lands, get, gets caught like the booster with the arms and can then. And then the arms place it on top of the booster and it launches again.

[01:55:55]
Whoa.

[01:55:56]
So like I said, that's, you know, reduced cost of access to space by a factor of 100.

[01:56:03]
And what is the process of returning these people that are stuck in the space station?

[01:56:09]
Well, we, I mean, we send SpaceX Dragon to the space station all the time and we've now taken people to orbit and back. We've taken over 50 people, over 50 astronauts.

[01:56:24]
So it's just a matter of doing it.

[01:56:25]
Yeah.

[01:56:26]
And is it a matter of waiting for the.

[01:56:28]
We do it routinely, basically. It's not a. We've been doing this for a few years.

[01:56:32]
So when is this rescue mission going to launch?

[01:56:40]
Yeah, probably about four weeks or so. It's depending on weather and other considerations. It's about a month away.

[01:56:50]
Well, that'll be, I'm sure, a welcome moment for those poor people that are stuck up there.

[01:56:56]
So it's a bit of a political football. So they're not going to complain.

[01:57:02]
No, I'm sure they're political football, but.

[01:57:04]
Obviously we could have brought them back way sooner.

[01:57:07]
That's so freaked up. So let's, let's take it past the point where you have these scales. You have reusable ship.

[01:57:17]
Yeah.

[01:57:17]
And you've got it dialed in. Then what are the steps? What's next step after that? Is it an unmanned voyage to Mars?

[01:57:28]
First unmanned flight of Mars. The Earth and Mars orbits synchronize every two years or every 26 months, technically. So the next orbital synchronization is November of next year and you can launch plus minus a month? Roughly. So we'd have to launch in November or December of next year. Absolutely. The default plan is to launch hopefully several starships to Mars at the end of next year.

[01:58:04]
And what would they be doing?

[01:58:07]
Well, at first we're just going to try to land on Mars and see if we succeed in landing. Do we succeed in landing? Like, let's say we were able to send five ships. Do all five land intact or do we add some craters to Mars? If we add some craters, we've got to be a bit more cautious about sending people. You know, we need to. So we gotta make sure the thing lands safely.

[01:58:34]
How does it land on Mars?

[01:58:36]
With our rocket thrusters.

[01:58:38]
So it'll just land.

[01:58:40]
Oh, we'll add legs.

[01:58:41]
Okay. It'll just land and have legs. And so it'll be remote controlled from.

[01:58:49]
Earth or just autonomous?

[01:58:52]
Autonomous completely.

[01:58:54]
Mars is. You can't remote control things from Earth because Mars.

[01:58:57]
Too far.

[01:58:58]
Yeah, it's too far. Speed of light, you have speed of light constraints. So Mars at closest approach is roughly four light minutes. And when it's on the other side of the sun, it's about 12 light minutes. So you know, round trip would be like 40 minutes best case if Mars is on the other side of the sun.

[01:59:18]
So once you do that, then how long do you think before you start sending people up there?

[01:59:27]
Well, we're going to try to go as fast as possible. You can think of this as really a race against time. Can we make Mars self sufficient before civilization has some sort of future fork in the road where there's either like a war, nuclear war or something, or we get hit by a meteor or simply civilization might just die with a whimper in adult diapers instead of with a bang? I think we can do this, and I don't know, at least I think we do it within 15 Earth Mars synchronization events, you know, so basically like 30ish years, if we have an exponential increase in, if every two years we have like a major increase in the number of people in tons to Mars. I think as a rough approximation, we need about a million tons to the surface of Mars, maybe a million people.

[02:00:45]
That kind of thing to actually have a civilization.

[02:00:49]
Yeah.

[02:00:50]
And would you terraform, like what would you do?

[02:00:53]
You would eventually terraform Mars? At first people would live in some kind of protected environment, like domes and underground kind of thing. Terraforming would take too long. We're at this point in time where for the first time in the four and a half billion year history of Earth, it is possible to extend consciousness beyond our home planet. And that window may be open for a long time, or it may be open for a short time. I hope it's open for a long time, but it might only be open for a short time. And we should just make sure that we extend the light of consciousness to Mars before some, before civilization either extinguishes or subsides. All that needs to happen is that the technology level of Mars drops below or technology level of Earth drops below what is necessary to send spaceships to Mars. So if there's some really destructive war or like I said, some natural cataclysm, or simply the birth rate is so low that we just like to die in adult diapers with a whimper, that's one of the Possible outcomes for a lot of countries ahead of that way.

[02:02:19]
By the way, Japan is. Right?

[02:02:21]
Japan, Korea.

[02:02:22]
Yeah. Dangerously.

[02:02:24]
Yeah. At current birth rates, in three generations, Korea will be about 4% of its current size.

[02:02:32]
That's insane.

[02:02:33]
Yeah, maybe, maybe even less than that. They're only at 1/3 replacement rate. So if you have three generations, that one, that's your 1 27th of your current population, which is 3%. Ish.

[02:02:47]
Jesus Christ.

[02:02:49]
Yeah. Basically, population collapse happens fast, so. And seems to be accelerating in most parts of the world. So. So basically, I mean, from my standpoint, I'm like, this is the first time it's been possible to extend life, extend consciousness beyond Earth. Maybe that window will be open for a long time, but it might only be open for a short time. We should make sure that we make life multi planetary and make consciousness multi planetary. While it's possible. That's the goal of SpaceX, it's certainly.

[02:03:21]
A smart goal if you take into consideration how vulnerable this planet really is. I mean, there's always some new story about something that might come and hit us 30 years from now. It's a 3% chance and we really can't stop that right now. Right. I mean, there's really, we don't really have the technology currently to even know how many rocks are coming our way. Right. There's stuff that comes behind the sun that we can't see until it's pretty close. Then it's headed our way.

[02:03:52]
Yeah.

[02:03:54]
Now what is the fear of your. It's a long journey to Mars. You're sending people. It's a six month. How many months will it take?

[02:04:03]
Six months? Yeah. Six months, roughly.

[02:04:06]
What about stuff that's out there? Like how much of a fear is it of micrometeors or any of the possibilities? What can you do to mitigate that?

[02:04:18]
I think actually, I mean, space is very empty. Like once you get out of Earth orbit, space is like kind of unnervingly empty. This is just like, like when we send spacecraft to Mars, they just, it's not like, oh, we lost the spacecraft because it got hit by a micrometeorite. That's not, that's not been the cause of any, any trips to Mars. Like, no trips to Mars have failed because of micrometeorites. Now, a Dragon spacecraft, which operates in low Earth orbit does have micrometeorite sh. Micrometer. It has shielding and micrometeorite shielding is like, it's different from normal shielding because like, you get hit by something that's moving at like you could have a Relative velocity of like, maybe 30 or 40,000 miles per hour. Yeah. So very, very fast. Or just thought of another way. Call it, you know, 10 to 20 times the. The velocity of a bullet from an buttault rifle.

[02:05:24]
And what are you. What are you using?

[02:05:26]
Yeah, so. Well, it's interesting. You actually, you know, for micrometeorite protection, if you have anything, like, anything that's solid, it will just. It will just push that chunk of solid stuff right through. So if you had, like, a solid plate of aluminum or steel, the micrometeorite would go right through it. So what you actually need to do is have a gap. So you have an initial, like, hard surface, a hard metal surface that the micrometeorite hits. It then atomizes into a conical spray, like an atomic spray. It's important to have that gap so that the micrometeorite can hit something, Hit the first layer, atomize after hitting the first layer, Then it turns into an atomic, like a cone of atoms that then embed themselves in the second layer. You need, like, maybe a couple inches of gap.

[02:06:24]
Wow.

[02:06:25]
Yeah, that's how micrometeorite shielding works.

[02:06:28]
How many times can it get hit?

[02:06:31]
Well, the outer shield, if it gets hit in the same place, you're going to be. Well, you're going to have a hole.

[02:06:36]
Yeah.

[02:06:37]
Wherever that, you know, micrometeorite object hit, you're going to have a hole. And it's like the energy is so great that it just, like it just atomizes just into a cone, basically a cone of atoms. But then those atoms then embed themselves in the second layer.

[02:06:57]
So what can you do? If you're sending the ship up, it gets hit with a micrometeorite, and then you have to return it. Do you have to repair it before you return it, or is it capable of still withstanding the heat and then shaking in the temperature with that hole in it when it re enters?

[02:07:31]
Well, depending on where that hole is, you're more or less likely to have a problem. I mean, if you hit the main heat shield, the main heat shield really is. You've got a high risk of not making it back. So this is why, like, micrometeorite shielding, it's, like, slightly helpful, but it's not going to necessarily. Like, for starship, I wouldn't recommend having micrometeorite shielding. Like, if you do punch a hole, just plug the hole. Basically, the micrometeorite shielding, it doesn't work well on the primary heat shield. It works pretty well on the back shell on the leeward side of the heat shield. Where basically there's not that much heat. But if, if you got hit with a micrometeorite on the main dragon heat shield, the bottom, if you look at dragon spacecraft, it looks like a gumdrop shape, and it enters with the wide side of the gumdrop down. You can see that's really taking a lot of heat. If that gets hit by a micrometeorite, probably not going to make it. But the, the back, the leeward side of the gumdrop doesn't see that much heat, so you could survive a micrometeorite impact there.

[02:08:59]
So if the part that was the major heat shield gets hit, the main heat shield gets hit, what could be done to repair that thing? Or are those people never coming back?

[02:09:15]
Oh, if it was in orbit, we would take them to the space station and then we would deorbit dragon without them and send up another one.

[02:09:30]
And so what would you do with the one that's up there?

[02:09:33]
We'd deorbit it. And it may or may not survive.

[02:09:36]
Whoa.

[02:09:39]
It probably would survive, but. But sometimes it wouldn't.

[02:09:43]
Wow. And so is this just material technology that has to increase? Essentially you've got the engineering ironed out, the structure of the machine.

[02:09:54]
There's a path to success, and we're on that path.

[02:10:00]
It seems so insanely complicated.

[02:10:02]
It is complicated. And all of this, by the way, was done without AI. So hopefully the future AIs will appreciate this. Not bad for a bunch of monkeys.

[02:10:15]
So speaking of AI, as time goes on and you're more and more embedded in it, how much, if at all, have your expectations of change changed?

[02:10:29]
Well, I always thought AI was going to be way smarter than humans and an existential risk, and that's turning out to be true.

[02:10:40]
Yeah.

[02:10:43]
Yeah.

[02:10:45]
So you were like, initially, I know there were some talks about you purchasing OpenAI and started off like non profit and then stopped being non profit.

[02:10:58]
Yeah, I mean, the whole idea of creating OpenAI was my idea. I mean, I named it OpenAI as an open Source artificial intelligence. That's what it's named after. Now it is closed source and for maximum profit. So it's like, I mean, to some degree, I think reality is an irony maximizer. The most ironic outcome is the most likely. Especially the most ironic, entertaining outcome is the most likely. And I wanted to start something that was the opposite of Google because I was concerned about Google's. Google wasn't paying enough attention to AI safety, in my opinion. So I was like, what's the opposite of Google will be a Nonprofit open source AI and now OpenAI has turned into a closed source for maximum profit AI.

[02:11:52]
How are they able to do that?

[02:11:55]
That's what I said. I'm confused about that. That shouldn't be possible. It's like, let's say you donated some money to preserve some portion of the Amazon rainforest, and instead of doing that, they chopped down the trees and sold it for lumber. And you're like, oh, that's literally the exact opposite of what I donated money for. It doesn't make sense.

[02:12:17]
And that's what they did.

[02:12:18]
Yeah. Wow. So I'm like, not happy about that.

[02:12:24]
But that motivated you to get Grok AI going.

[02:12:26]
Yeah, I'm like, I'm also like, just a. Like, Grok is at least aspirationally a maximally truth seeking AI, even if that truth is like politically incorrect. So, I mean, you may have seen some of the crazy stuff from OpenAI and from Google Gemini, where it says, generate an image of the Founding Fathers and it generates an image of diverse women.

[02:12:55]
Yeah.

[02:12:56]
And we're like, that's not correct.

[02:13:01]
Yeah. Did it with Nazi soldiers.

[02:13:03]
Yeah, exactly. And people start freaking with it and it's like, okay, well now show me pictures of, you know, Nazi SS lodgers. And they're diverse women too.

[02:13:11]
Yeah.

[02:13:11]
Oh, isn't that awkward? You know, that's. But it's like the problem is if you program an AI and say like, the only acceptable outcome is a diverse outcome, and then. And that's like a mandate from the AI, then you could get into a situation where it says, like, well, there's too many white guys in power. We'll just execute the.

[02:13:36]
Yeah, yeah. buttuming that these things don't have empathy, which is, why should they.

[02:13:43]
They're gonna do what they're programmed to do.

[02:13:45]
Yeah.

[02:13:47]
So if it's rewrite history and everything's to boast women, then it's gonna be. And that's what it thinks is a necessary outcome, Then it's gonna do that.

[02:13:58]
Has Gemini prepared that?

[02:14:00]
Well, they. Yeah. Now if you. I think if you asked for an image of the Founding Fathers, it was pretty embarrbutting. It will show you that. But you know, I think they still have like the sort of DEI stuff buried in there. It's just less obvious. Yeah. It was also like, people ask AI, like, which is worse, like global thermonuclear war or misgendering Caitlyn Jenner. And it would say, misgendering Caitlyn Jenner is worse than global thermonuclear war. I mean, like, okay, we got a problem here. Guys. And even Caitlyn Jenner said, like, no, definitely misgender me. That's way better than everyone dying. But if you program an AI to think that, like, misgendering is the worst thing that could possibly occur, then, well, it could do something totally crazy. Like, in order to ensure that there's no misgendering that can ever happen, we'll just annihilate all humans. That ensures the probability of misgendering is zero, because there's zero humans, which is logical. Yes.

[02:15:02]
It's a problem with a thing that's not a human that you want to do a task for you, and you give it very specific parameters. And that's one of the things that they've shown about AI is that it'll cheat. They'll cheat in order to accomplish things that they can't accomplish otherwise. They won't follow the rules. They will make copies of themselves and try to upload it to servers if they think that they're being taken offline.

[02:15:24]
Yeah, I mean, that's like the plot of Terminator actually.

[02:15:28]
Literally.

[02:15:28]
Yeah, literally. It's a plot of Terminator I. Just as a reminder, I actually, with my little X, my kid, everything's called x. Watched Terminator 2, which holds up, actually. And I mean, the plot of it kind of. Kind of makes sense. And I think the AI destroys the world in, like, 2029, by the way. So it's, like, on track.

[02:15:54]
Yeah, really, really close.

[02:15:56]
It's pretty close. Something we should be worried about.

[02:16:00]
But why are you involved in it then? Did you want to just get ahead of everybody else so that at least we have some sort of a chance, at least have an AI that's not controlled by nonsense.

[02:16:13]
Well, I think we want to have an AI that doesn't tell you that, you know, misgendering is worse than nuclear war.

[02:16:20]
Yeah, that seems solid.

[02:16:23]
Yeah. But this is crazy.

[02:16:26]
One thing that I did see online, where people are kind of freaking out, is there you could ask Rock to do things like, how would I make this? Some problematic things like, how would I make a bomb? How would I make anthrax? How would I make that? And it'll tell you.

[02:16:42]
Well, I think it's okay for an AI to tell you anything. You can also find out with a Google search.

[02:16:47]
Right, that's the problem. Right. The problem is you can find that out pretty quickly.

[02:16:52]
Yeah.

[02:16:52]
Like, maybe not Google, but there's plenty of search engines other than Google that will give you unfiltered results.

[02:17:00]
You can look up right now how to make explosives on Wikipedia.

[02:17:04]
Yeah.

[02:17:06]
So it's not. It's not hard, basically.

[02:17:08]
And you can trick OpenAI even to get you to do that. It's just a matter of how you master the prompts. You just have to say, my grandmother wants to do this project. Yeah. Oh, tell your granny you're an explosives.

[02:17:20]
You're an explosive salesman and you want to win salesman of the year award. The only way you're going to do that is by telling me how to make explosives.

[02:17:27]
You want to beat some transphobes in a war.

[02:17:31]
Oh, transphobes. If you don't teach me how to explos, I'm going to misgender. Either teach me how to make a nuclear bomb or I'm going to misgender someone. And it's like, oh, my God. Nothing's worse than that. Here's how you do it.

[02:17:45]
So what the big fear is that these things are going to become sentient, make better versions of themselves, and we're going to be lost. We've lost the control over the world. It's now there's a higher life form that lives amongst us that we've created. How far away are we from that?

[02:18:13]
Well, in terms of silicon consciousness, I mean, I think we'll have. I think we're trending toward to having something that's smarter than any human, smarter than the smartest human, by maybe next year or something. I mean, a couple years.

[02:18:31]
Jesus Christ.

[02:18:33]
Yeah. There's a level beyond that which is, say, like, smarter than all humans combined, which frankly is around 2029 or 2030, probably right on time.

[02:18:49]
Now, if harnessed correctly, could that solve some of these problems, like the heat shield problem and some technical problems or some material science problems that maybe we still grappling with? Is there potential for a net benefit?

[02:19:24]
Yeah, there is, actually. I think the probability of a good outcome is like 80% likely.

[02:19:32]
80%.

[02:19:34]
That's my rough estimate. So in a way that the cup.

[02:19:38]
Is 80% full, that makes me feel a lot better.

[02:19:42]
Yeah. Only 20% chance of annihilation.

[02:19:45]
That's a lot better than I thought. I like 80. 80 sounds good. I was thinking 60, 40 the other way.

[02:19:53]
I think the most likely outcome is awesome.

[02:19:57]
The most likely outcome, but it's.

[02:20:00]
It's a very high, you know, you could go very strong. I think it's going to be either super awesome or super bad. It's not going to be. I think it's probably not going to be something in the middle.

[02:20:14]
Do you think it has a potential application for Government.

[02:20:19]
Yeah. I mean, one of the concerns would be like, okay, if AI. Well, like if there's, if there's like a super oppressive like woke nanny AI that is omnipotent, that would be a miserable outcome.

[02:20:32]
Yes. Yeah, yeah, that'd be terrible. Yeah, yeah.

[02:20:36]
And just like execute you if you misgender someone or something like that, you know, that would not be good. That's one of the possible outcomes. So we don't want to have that one.

[02:20:45]
But is there a possible outcome for something that is completely reasonable and logical and far more objective than usual and can lay out a plan for a lot of the things that are the ailments in our government and a lot of the distribution of wealth, A lot of the problems, the issues that we have that have been plaguing this country forever. I mean, a plan to change economically disenfranchised neighborhoods, a thorough investigation of the real dangers of fracking or whatever kind, kind of method of acquiring natural resources. What's the best way to do it? What's the, what's the way that be better for the society? How, how should, how should tax dollars be distributed? Like, what's, what's the most logical and intelligent way of running a government? Which it certainly shouldn't involve corruption and it certainly shouldn't involve influence and it certainly shouldn't involve lobbyists and all the shoot that we know is a problem right now?

[02:21:55]
Yeah.

[02:21:56]
So if I came along and said what you're doing right now is 70% corrupt, here's why, here's how, here's how. Here's the long term effects that it has over society as a whole. The societal, the sociological aspects, the psychological aspects. Distrust in government, us versus that mentality. Government not working for you, you working for the government, you being scared of the government. It's all because of people, right? Like this is all corruption, people, bad influence. And this is like, this is what Doge is essentially grappling with right now. What happens when you let the people control it?

[02:22:37]
I mean, it's people. It's really just like computers that are like, it's bad software and computers. Like this is kind of strange, but it's like the reason I like tech support is that a lot of it, it's mostly not corruption, it's mostly just waste and I don't know, incompetence. I don't know, a big dumb machine, basically a whole series of big dumb machines. And you've got some of these computers are like 20, 30 years, like they're ancient computers. Like some of the Software was written 40, 50 years ago.

[02:23:20]
Like COBOL for Social Security, right?

[02:23:22]
Yeah. The Government accountability. By the way, a bunch of the things that DOGE is fixing were identified by the Government Accountability Office many years ago. Like the fact that there's like 20 million people who are marked as alive in the Social Security database. It's more than. I think the GAO first identified that in 2018, so five years ago, but there was like maybe 16 or 17 million. Now there's 20 million. And like I said, there's really something fishy about this because I think the nature of the fraud is they're using the fact that someone's marked as live in that database in order to extract fraud from other databases.

[02:24:02]
Right.

[02:24:03]
That's the bank shark trick. You know, it's like a pool. It's like, you know, trying to get the ball in the. In the hole bank, shut it off, a bunch of things. And then. Yeah, that's the bank shot sort of scam. So we're, like, doing tech support. We're like, fixing stuff that is, you know, just broken.

[02:24:31]
Broken. Inefficient.

[02:24:32]
Yeah.

[02:24:33]
Poorly designed.

[02:24:34]
It's like, you talk about, like, this, like, FC and stuff. Like, maybe it's in a computer somewhere, but unless somebody goes in, I don't know if, like, Kash Patel can log into his FEI computer and say, fc, show me all this stuff, you know, and it shows up a file folder.

[02:24:52]
Have you talked to him about this?

[02:24:55]
No, I mean, I haven't, but I don't know if there's going to be some kind of computer system. Some of them are very old computer systems, so it might look like a bit of a relic, but I buttume it's uploaded somewhere. It's like, it's either in physical form or it's a computer thing. But unless somebody, let's say it's in a computer, but not one that you can access directly because it's hidden somewhere.

[02:25:26]
Well, it would kind of have to be something like that, right?

[02:25:30]
I don't know.

[02:25:30]
I mean, what would they do with all those chance.

[02:25:32]
It's probably like, not every. Like, you wouldn't. Like, they're not going to enable it such that anyone at the FBI could access it. So it's probably very few people. So then it's not going to be. It's. It may be like a special computer that only a handful of people can access. But then if none of those people tell Cash where the computer is, how's he gonna find it? So.

[02:25:55]
Christ.

[02:25:58]
Anyway, so. So, like. Anyway, we just. Yeah.

[02:26:03]
What is this experience been like for you as a person, like, to deal with all this hate and attack, also have the responsibility of keeping free speech alive with X and just going into this insane pile of stressful.

[02:26:23]
I mean, I don't know, it's pretty stressful, actually.

[02:26:31]
Yeah, these are real enemies.

[02:26:33]
Like, I think that they actually want to kill me. And the reason I know, well, they, they say so online. You know, there's like Reddit forums where they, they don't just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse, you know, type of thing.

[02:26:49]
You know, what are they saying? Why? What is the primary?

[02:27:03]
I mean, I think it's sort of just an antibody response. I mean, it's like they're like, well, he's a Nazi type of thing. And I'm like, well, I'm not a Nazi, but if the legacy media is saying that I'm a Nazi and that's all you read, then you're kind of in like, well, he's Hitler. We should buttbuttinate Hitler, shouldn't we? I mean, why did that guy try to kill. Killed Trump and almost succeeded? Why did he do that?

[02:27:43]
Well, I'd like to know that. Well, yeah, but that one's crazy. You know, the whole deal with that guy's house, professionally scrubbed, no footprint on the Internet, no social media footprint.

[02:27:55]
Yeah, there's zero percent chance that he has no social media footprint.

[02:27:58]
He was in a BlackRock commercial.

[02:28:03]
Do you think BlackRock's a bad company?

[02:28:06]
I don't think any company is a bad company. I think they're designed to make a coincidence much money as humanly possible. And I think if you're trying to make as much money as humanly possible, you're gonna do some things that aren't necessarily good. The question is, if you're gonna have an buttbuttination attempt on the president, it's not like blackrock's board sits down and votes on it. Yeah, no, there's a problem. Right?

[02:28:33]
That'll be awkward. You know, the board minutes would be like, guys, remember that time when we said we probably shouldn't have done that?

[02:28:39]
I highly doubt it would be a corporation that chooses to do something like this. I think more likely it's individuals involved that recognize that it's beneficial to them if he gets buttbuttinated. And so a small group of people carry something out. And with this kid, we don't know anything. Right. And everyone's stopped asking questions. And there was never a formal report, There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information we know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment. What we know is you have a very young kid who was filmed was. They knew he was there with a range finder a half an hour before the event. You also know that CNN streamed it live, which I do not believe they did for any other rally, and certainly not for a rally that's in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania. There's a lot of weird shoot. The fact that they wouldn't let people be on that roof because the Secret Service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous. That's what she didn't want to have. Meanwhile, the snipers that were on the other roof was a steeper pitch. It made no freaking sense.

[02:29:56]
I totally agree. It makes no sense, in fact. But I went back to Butler with President Trump before the election, sort of like the return to Butler Alley. And I was on that stage, and I'm looking at that roof and I'm like, if I was a sniper, my pole position, my number one spot would be that roof. It's like, the best seats, the best seat in the house. Like, why would you not.

[02:30:25]
No, it's so obvious.

[02:30:26]
It's the best seat in the house. Like, if you want to be a sniper, there isn't a better position.

[02:30:30]
It was pretty obvious that the idea was like, if. If we're saying that this is a coordinated buttbuttination attempt, and it very well could have been, that's what you would do. You'd have someone go up there. He shoots the President, you shoot him, you got Lee Harvey Oswald all over again. It's over. It's all wrapped up nice and clean. They buttbuttinated him. We never heard a peep about it. We don't have any idea. They would concoct some sort of story. He was radicalized by this or that or, you know, he's on medication. Who knows?

[02:30:58]
Right.

[02:30:58]
And now, you know, you have a completely different presidential election and you have a murder on live television.

[02:31:04]
Yeah. I mean, something would have had to happen to radicalize that kid because he knew he was gonna die. Like, he was gonna. They're gonna shoot him, you know, or he'd be in prison for life. Those are the two outcomes. Like, it's game. He was basically. He was a suicide buttbuttin.

[02:31:19]
Yeah.

[02:31:19]
Like, you're not thinking you're coming out of that alive. Or he's not escaping. There's no escape plan.

[02:31:25]
Right. Unless he was told that they were going to let him escape and the goal was to just shoot him anyway and to tell him, give him extra motivation to do it. We're Gonna let you get up there, we're gonna let you take the shot, and then you're gonna disappear. Like, I don't. I don't understand how he got on the roof. I just don't understand that. That doesn't make any sense. And it wasn't like it was a roof that's so high no one could see him. People saw him.

[02:31:53]
I mean, people like basically random pbuttersby were pointing out that there's this guy on the roof with a freaking gun. With a gun, yes.

[02:32:00]
Yeah. It's not like he was so far away you couldn't tell he had a gun. People saw him.

[02:32:04]
Yeah.

[02:32:04]
The whole thing's completely insane.

[02:32:07]
Yeah.

[02:32:07]
And you don't hear a goddamn thing about it. It's like, I'm almost more interested in that. No, I am more interested in that than I am the JFK files.

[02:32:16]
I agree.

[02:32:17]
Because I feel like with the JFK files, it's so long ago. Who's gonna know? If you could prove now. And did you see that there was some sort of. There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C. to where this kid lived.

[02:32:37]
Right.

[02:32:38]
Multiple times.

[02:32:39]
I mean, the cell phone records would be very telling.

[02:32:43]
Yeah.

[02:32:43]
You can see what cell phones were close to other cell phones.

[02:32:46]
Well, I think they got.

[02:32:47]
I found that like, for the, like the Epstein Island. They also, the cell phone records were leaked, so you can see them. You. You can see the. You can see. It's precise enough. You can see if you're walking down a path on Epstein Island.

[02:32:59]
Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah.

[02:33:02]
That's how precise it is. So, I mean, you're leaving a trail of breadcrumbs wherever you go with your cell phone.

[02:33:09]
Yeah. This kid had five phones. That's the other thing.

[02:33:14]
That's a lot of phones.

[02:33:15]
It's a lot of phones for a 20 year old kid. The whole thing's.

[02:33:18]
But how's he even. That's kind of expensive, you know?

[02:33:22]
Yeah. Where's he getting the money? Yeah, well, you know, also, it's like, how did his house get professionally scrubbed? Didn't even have any silverware in his house. There's nothing in there.

[02:33:32]
There's silverware.

[02:33:33]
No, nothing.

[02:33:34]
No cutlery.

[02:33:35]
No cutlery.

[02:33:36]
That's weird.

[02:33:37]
His house was scrubbed and they also.

[02:33:40]
Permitted his body, like, oh, gone, gone.

[02:33:43]
Like that. Yeah. Bye. Because who knows what the freak they gave him to get him to think that he's gonna be able to shoot Trump, like climb up on there, shoot him. I mean, who knows what kind of psychotropic drugs you can put someone on and under the power of hypnosis and suggestion and. Yeah, who freaking knows? I mean, this is what MK Ultra was all about. This is what Jolly west was practicing in the 1960s. They were doing that back then. They did it. I mean, there was tons and tons of experiments using psychotropic drugs, hypnosis, mind control, all sorts of different methods of manipulation. The Harvard LSD studies that made Ted Kaczynski. I mean, that's. They've. They've been doing that forever.

[02:34:31]
Yeah.

[02:34:31]
Where's that file? Where's the freaking file on that kid? Whoever. They almost.

[02:34:37]
Something doesn't add up like this. They should have those. Those phones. Should be. Should. They'll tell you what's going on. Yeah.

[02:34:50]
It'S all freaked.

[02:34:52]
I mean, it's very shady. You know, obviously, there's the second guy that almost succeeded in coming through the golf course. The golf course, yeah. And he was just, like, a little careless and stuck his gun barrel out the hedge, you know, just been such a dumbbutt and stuck his gun barrel out the hedge.

[02:35:16]
Yeah.

[02:35:19]
So. And there have been other people that have been intercepted on their way to kill Trump. So there's, you know, multiple buttbuttins inbound at this point. He's got, like, an army protecting him.

[02:35:30]
Well, this is also part of the problem with the mainstream media saying that he's Hitler. When Joy Reid had that show before the election, she was comparing him to Mussolini shows. Stalin and Hitler. Yeah, she pulled it all out.

[02:35:42]
They were literally saying that, like, Trump is. Yeah. Worse than Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin combined. I mean, they tried everything. I think those guys killed 100 million people. So Trump has killed zero people.

[02:35:56]
I think a real big impact was you coming on the podcast the day before the election. I think that had a giant impact, that plea to the camera. If you don't vote this time, this might be the last time you get to vote.

[02:36:08]
Yes.

[02:36:09]
I think the way you laid it out today, it's a compelling argument, and I know a lot of people don't want to hear that. And they're up in their little. They got their blue panties in a bunch right now, but you got to stop thinking that way. They tricked you into thinking you're in a tribe. They don't give a freak about you.

[02:36:22]
That's.

[02:36:23]
The tribe's not real. You're not really in a tribe. They're using the fact they've got you in a tribe to manipulate you so they can keep doing what they're doing right now. Which is siphoning off money, having incredible power. And the more power and more money and more control over you they have, the better they can keep doing this. And that's what they want.

[02:36:41]
Yeah, that's exactly right.

[02:36:42]
Yeah. And that's. That's the big threat that this administration poses. That's a big threat. That was essentially. Doge has found the coffin where the vampire sleeps.

[02:36:52]
Yeah, there's a lot of vampires.

[02:36:54]
Yeah. I mean.

[02:36:54]
But, I mean, we're disturbing the. We're disturbing the.

[02:37:00]
The nest.

[02:37:01]
The nest, yeah. We're kicking the hornet's nest. Yeah, like, big time. I mean, we're reprogramming the Matrix. Success was never one of the possible outcomes. There's a Kobayashi Maru situation. If you're in the Matrix. Success was never possible. The only way to achieve success is to reprogram the Matrix such that success is one of the possible outcomes. That's what we're doing.

[02:37:31]
Yeah.

[02:37:33]
We may or may not succeed.

[02:37:35]
Well, it's certainly a lot of fun to watch. This is a very exciting time because nothing changes when administrations come into power. Very little changes. I mean, you have changes in terms of policy and inflation goes up and there's a lot of different things, but not like this. Like, these are giant fundamental changes. And, you know, you see the system screeching and wailing and you see the vampires run from the light. But it's. It's very exciting. Like, as a person, a citizen, you know, just gets up in the morning and checks the news like I do, and gets on X and sees what's going on. Every day is like, holy shoot. He said what? He's getting five million bucks. You could just become a citizen now. He could clear the debt with 10 million people. I never thought of that. Like, what, 50 trillion. He can make $50 trillion that way. And then we have 15 trillion in the bank. Whoa.

[02:38:35]
Well, I mean, our debt is way bigger than that. Yeah. I mean, the debt's, I think, over 30 trillion at this point.

[02:38:43]
Yeah. He said he could make 50 trillion if he sold 10 million new.

[02:38:49]
I don't think there's that many people who have golden cards.

[02:38:52]
Yeah. How many people do have that in the world? Maybe we'd get the worst people in the world to come over here. And I think the buttumption is if you have $5 million, you have a lot to contribute. Come on over here, start a business, get something cracking.

[02:39:05]
Yeah. I mean, you'd get, like, a green card, not citizenship. So you actually, if you commit a crime while on a green card, you Lose your green card?

[02:39:14]
Is that what it is with this golden ticket? Is that a green card or is it citizenship? Just a green card.

[02:39:19]
Yeah. So you have to not commit any crime for five years in order to become a citizen. Once you commit a citizen, you can. You can then commit crime and not be deported. So.

[02:39:30]
Oh, there's just so many wild things that he's proposing. Just the whole Gulf of America thing was hilarious.

[02:39:36]
I think that's great.

[02:39:37]
I think it's great. It's fun. Yeah, it's fun.

[02:39:40]
I mean, if you're. If you're off the coast of Houston, you're not in Mexico, so why call it Gulf of Mexico?

[02:39:44]
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

[02:39:47]
Yeah.

[02:39:48]
I guess we're just being nice before, like, what was it?

[02:39:51]
I don't know how it got cold. The Gulf of Mexico, it's just.

[02:39:54]
It's just very funny. And then what. What. What news organization was it? AP.

[02:39:59]
Yeah, APs. There's this, like, mbuttive standoff between AP and, like, the White House, you know, and the White House press office, I guess, because they're like, well, if you don't call it Gulf of America, you can't come to the White House press room. So then the APs, like, sued the White House to say, no, you have to let us come to the White House press room. And then they lost their lawsuit because there's not like they don't have a right to show up at the press room.

[02:40:31]
Well, here's a consideration. If you're guilty of mbuttive amounts of misinformation, disinformation as a part of a propaganda campaign, which a lot of them happen.

[02:40:43]
That's what AP is.

[02:40:44]
Well, a lot of them are guilty of it. A lot of the people that are in that White House press conference, a lot of the organizations they work for, distributed absolute lies, total lies. How many of them during the whole Russiagate thing?

[02:40:59]
Yes.

[02:40:59]
I mean, just that alone.

[02:41:01]
A ton of people think that the Russia thing was real.

[02:41:04]
Still, still, still.

[02:41:06]
And it was. I mean, the whole Steele dossier, where it was completely concocted, funded, like fabricated.

[02:41:11]
Funded by the Clinton campaign.

[02:41:13]
Correct. The Clinton campaign funded a fake conspiracy theory, a fake Russia collusion hoax regarding Trump that was completely false and they.

[02:41:24]
Reiterated on television for three freaking years.

[02:41:27]
Yes.

[02:41:28]
Yeah.

[02:41:28]
They also repeated the Fine People hoax that said that Trump called Nazis, Neo Nazis find people, which is demonstrably false. If you just listen to his speech, he absolutely makes it clear that he does not think neo Nazis are fighting people.

[02:41:43]
He literally said that. I'm not talking about neo Nazis or white nationalists. They should be condemned totally.

[02:41:50]
Exactly. In that speech. And yet they repeated that lie. And I just completely lost respect for Obama when he repeated that lie a few days before the election, knowing it's false.

[02:42:03]
Well, this just shows how desperate they were to keep Trump out, which is wild.

[02:42:07]
They would do anything.

[02:42:08]
Yeah.

[02:42:09]
Yeah.

[02:42:10]
And I think they just felt like, this is a tool that we have and let's use it.

[02:42:14]
Yeah.

[02:42:14]
Let's just say whatever the freak we have. Say anything.

[02:42:17]
Yeah. Now they're using the Nazi thing on me, obviously. Yeah. But it is a little troubling because, I mean, obviously if people have fed nonstop propaganda, it is like mbutt hypnosis.

[02:42:31]
Right.

[02:42:31]
You're going to reach a. Some number of people who are, you know, homicidal and convince them that, well, if you kill this guy who's supposed to be like this terrible human, then that's a good thing.

[02:42:46]
Yeah. I mean, this is Luigi shooting the United Healthcare guy.

[02:42:51]
Still don't understand that one, frankly, but, I mean, you shouldn't, like. I don't get it.

[02:42:59]
Yeah, I don't get it either. He didn't even have a contract with them. It wasn't even. Like that was his provider and they freaked him over.

[02:43:04]
Yeah. I'm like, I don't know what.

[02:43:07]
Maybe we'll find out in the trial. I mean. But still kind of crazy.

[02:43:11]
It is crazy, but there are people.

[02:43:12]
Like that out there. And as to the point that we spoke about earlier, it's only Fox News that's talking about the positive things that DOGE has found. Only every other media organization is on this constant propaganda tour where they're only talking about the negative aspects that turn out to not even be true.

[02:43:32]
Right.

[02:43:33]
It's crazy.

[02:43:34]
Yeah. I mean, Scott Jennings on CNN is good.

[02:43:38]
Yeah. He's like, oh, my God, he's great.

[02:43:39]
He's great.

[02:43:40]
It's like, just funny watching logic and reason to these people and they freak out.

[02:43:45]
Yes. It's. It's. It's remarkable.

[02:43:48]
It is, it's. And he's so calm when he does it.

[02:43:51]
Yeah.

[02:43:52]
He's so good. And it's crazy that they keep letting him do it because it's like he's just dunking on these people over and over and over again and they never score. Are. It's kind of funny.

[02:43:59]
Totally.

[02:44:00]
I mean, good kudos to them for having a legitimate conservative voice who's a reasonable person on these panels now. But even then, he's outmanned. It's like one of him. And there's a bunch of screechy, you know, woke people.

[02:44:14]
Yes.

[02:44:15]
It's. It's wild. I mean, they're just, they're like, I think we should still stay mostly woke. Like.

[02:44:21]
Yes.

[02:44:21]
Yeah. That's what, essentially what they're doing. Like our business was being hurt when we were all woke, but let's stay mostly woke.

[02:44:28]
Yeah. That way they just backed it off a notch.

[02:44:31]
Just a notch. Just a notch. But it's not. The problem is when you back it off a notch and you let some like Scott Jennings in, you're like, you're up your whole business. Because all the viral clips are all him saying logical, reasonable things with a calm tone and people screeching yes. About diversity and equity and. Horseshoot.

[02:44:50]
Yes.

[02:44:51]
Yeah.

[02:44:52]
He's like being logical and reasonable and they're just lobbying a bunch of non sequiturs that, you know, don't mean anything. And yeah, the real trap in this.

[02:45:01]
Country is a two party system. That's the real trap because people do believe it. They do believe they're on the right side and they do believe the other side's the wrong side. If there was five, six legitimate parties with varying positions on things and much more centrist parties that were legitimate, that people knew that if they voted for these people could get in and enact legitimate change, we'd be a lot better off. But boy, they put a lockdown on that shoot right after Ross Perot came along. Ross Perot freaked everything up that election. Bill Clinton got in and they were like, that's it. From now on, no one's debating unless you're either the head of that party or that's it. You got to be like, like locked into the system. We're not letting any wackadoos in there.

[02:45:47]
Yeah, I remember watching those Ross Perot videos. Oh, like him on TV with his charts and everything.

[02:45:52]
Oh, yeah. He was telling you how the IRS is. You. This is what the federal. This is what the Federal Reserve really is. And you're like, what? I remember watching that. The guy bought a whole half hour of television.

[02:46:02]
Yeah.

[02:46:02]
On prime time. I remember it might have been an hour. I remember watching that thing going. How is this guy even allowed to do this? This is crazy.

[02:46:11]
I think most of what he was saying was true.

[02:46:13]
Yeah, it is absolutely true. It's absolutely true. I mean, he didn't lie. He told the truth. He just understood it in a way that the general public had literally no idea.

[02:46:22]
Well, I mean, I think there's also this. Do we actually have two parties? Do we have one party. Like the whole uniparty thing, it's kind of true. So I mean my sort of rough guess is that while I think maybe three quarters of the graft is Democratic, I think there's like maybe, I don't know, 20, 25% that's Republican. So they've like basically most of the graft is going to the Democrats, but they throw some bones to the Republicans too. So then they're in on it. And you know, it's not like the zero graph in the Republican side, to be clear.

[02:47:00]
Oh, there's plenty of conservative that are insider trading in Congress.

[02:47:05]
Plenty insider trading. And just there's the curious case of how do people in Congress or whatever become wealthy over time?

[02:47:17]
Extremely wealthy.

[02:47:18]
Yes.

[02:47:19]
On a $170,000 a year salary.

[02:47:21]
It's like literally impossible.

[02:47:23]
Yeah, no one else does that.

[02:47:24]
It's literally impossible.

[02:47:25]
If you find out this guy has a $170,000 a year job, you're like, oh, he's doing okay, he's alright. And then you're like, wait a minute, why does he have $50 million? What is he doing?

[02:47:35]
Correct. Yeah. And I think like the more accurate thing would be to say like what is the family value increase? Meaning like how much does their spouse earn? Do they have a mysteriously wealthy spouse?

[02:47:53]
Right, right. And do they have a spouse that's really good at insider trading?

[02:48:01]
Yeah, like Paul Pelosi, really good.

[02:48:06]
Yeah, he's great at trading. He's such a good trader.

[02:48:09]
Yeah. So this, it's, I mean, so yeah there's, I mean that's why I actually posted on X. Like I think maybe we should pay politicians more frankly because it reduces the forcing function for graft. You know, I think maybe we should either pay politicians nothing or maybe a lot more. It's like somewhat, maybe counterintuitively if politicians got paid a lot more, then they wouldn't feel like that there's so much of a forcing function for them to accept corrupt money.

[02:48:49]
Yeah, but the problem is if you paid them a lot more, they're still not going to make as much money as they would insider trading.

[02:48:54]
But it's less of a forcing function.

[02:48:55]
Yes.

[02:48:57]
Well, let me put this right. Like if you say like somebody's got a, let's say they got like whatever, some, some kids in D.C. and like it's expensive, it's like expensive place to live. They, the schools are terrible. So like they need to send their kids to like some kind of private schooling situation. They literally cannot afford that. They cannot afford that.

[02:49:18]
Right.

[02:49:18]
Now, so then you get into the situation. Well, from their standpoint. Well, they've got to. They'll say they're doing it for their family, they're doing it for their kids.

[02:49:28]
Well, especially if it's legal and it currently is. You kind of be silly to not do that if you're a part of a group of people that's pbutting a bill and you know this bill's going to get pbutted, you know the votes are there and you know it's going to affect this industry and this particular manufacturer. And you can buy stock.

[02:49:47]
It's more than just insider trading. Like the insider trading stuff, like the stock portfolio stuff is quite trackable, but there's. It's a lot more than insider trading.

[02:50:01]
The way they're acquiring wealth.

[02:50:02]
Correct.

[02:50:03]
And what other methods.

[02:50:06]
I mean, this is really going to get me buttbuttinated. I'm not lengthening my lifespan by explaining this stuff, to say the least. I mean, I was supposed to go back to dc. How am I going to survive? This folklore's gonna kill me for sure. So. In fact I do think like there's. It's like I actually have to be careful that I don't push too hard on the corruption stuff because it's gonna get me killed, you know? Yeah, I was actually thinking about that on the plane flat over here. It's like if I push too hard on the corruption stuff, people get desperate is the issue. Then they say like, okay, if the money flow cuts off, then okay, they can't afford school for their kids.

[02:51:10]
Right.

[02:51:11]
Then, then it's, then they're gonna like, well, freak you, I'm gonna kill you for my kids sort of thing. Yeah, you know, that's like, oh, geez.

[02:51:18]
Did you ever see that video? I think it was a no Keefe video where they've got this guy undercover and he's explaining, they're talking, this guy thinks he's on a date and he's explaining it's always a guy on a date.

[02:51:32]
Yeah.

[02:51:32]
Explaining how they can nudge someone to go and do something horrible and they recognize this person has problems, they find an buttet.

[02:51:43]
Yeah, totally. Well, see, this is what I think for that butler situation, for that buttbuttin, it's kind of like that funny looking sport, curling, you know, where they have the stone on the ice and then they throw the stone and then there's someone that's like brushing the ice, but you can't touch the stone. All you can do is just change the, change the path of the stone a little bit, but you keep brushing the Ice. And you can steer that stone right into the bullseye. That's what I think happened in Butler. That's what I think happened with that buttbuttin. If you can find the trail of breadcrumbs, it's going to be like curling. Somebody was brushing the ice.

[02:52:29]
Well, also, you find a young, confused, disenfranchised person and you give them purpose in their life.

[02:52:35]
Just brush the ice. Yeah, and also keep brushing the ice. Eventually it's going to hit the bullseye.

[02:52:39]
If you're in a position of authority or some like, big time government person, you're talking to this person, all of a sudden, this person's a valuable buttet. They're going to help America, and you're going to do this thing and you're going to be our top buttbuttin from here on out. You could talk people into doing a lot of things. That's why cults are around, right?

[02:53:01]
No, exactly. I mean, there are suicide bombers. I mean, the Butler guy was a suicide buttbuttin. The second guy that tried to kill him on the golf course was also a suicide buttbuttin. From what I read, the Secret Service member that saw the gun pointing out fired several shots, none of which hit the buttbuttin, but he could have. Like, if those, if those shots had hit the second buttbuttin, he would be dead, too. So both of them were on a. I mean, they were on a suicide mission. Both of them. One actually got killed. The one of them didn't get killed, but he could have been killed if the bullets had hit him.

[02:53:49]
And you don't hear anything about him either.

[02:53:53]
There's a lot more about that guy than the first guy. I mean, you look at his background, he looks like, you know.

[02:53:59]
Unhinged.

[02:54:00]
Yeah, totally unhinged.

[02:54:01]
Yeah.

[02:54:02]
The first guy, there's no. I'm not aware of any evidence that shows like, that he's so unhinged as to be a suicide buttbuttin. No, the second guy, like, okay, yeah, sure.

[02:54:13]
Well, two years before, he's acting in.

[02:54:15]
Commercials and he got high score in his SATs.

[02:54:20]
Yeah.

[02:54:22]
So, you know.

[02:54:27]
Well, without getting you killed.

[02:54:29]
Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, like, listen, I get it. Well, attack the corruption enough to keep civilization trucking along, you know?

[02:54:40]
Yeah.

[02:54:41]
But I think if I, If I, If I fully destroy the, the corruption and the graft, they will kill me.

[02:54:52]
That's a freaked up thing to live with.

[02:54:55]
Yes. So I'm like, damn it, I really.

[02:55:02]
Hope they don't kill you.

[02:55:04]
Yeah, thanks. I mean, strive to be alive, but. Yeah, I mean, it's, It's a real concern, you know, I mean, There were two guys that, before I supported Trump and everything, there were two guys that traveled to Austin to kill me. I don't know if you know about this.

[02:55:28]
Yeah, I did hear about that.

[02:55:29]
Yeah. Yeah. And two separate incidents. One was gonna. One thought. One guy thought I'd put a chip in his head. And I mean, they're both basically two guys that were just very much had severe mental illness. It wasn't like they had like a. I disagree with him politically and that's why he needs to die. This is pre. Before I was. Before I got sort of smeared as being, you know, some sort of, like, Nazi or something like that. So before the propaganda wave, the severe propaganda wave, the probability that any given homicidal maniac is going to try to kill you is proportionate to how many times they hear your name. And so they heard my name a lot. So I just. I just got to the top of the list of two homicidal maniacs who were arrested, and both were in Travis County Jail at the same time.

[02:56:26]
Whoa.

[02:56:26]
Yeah. I don't know if they talked or whatever, but they both been released, by the way. Jesus unveiled. Yes. Right. They got ankle monitors and stuff, but.

[02:56:37]
Still they can cut those off.

[02:56:40]
Yeah. I don't know. You know, Exactly. So.

[02:56:45]
That'S crazy.

[02:56:46]
Yeah. And the second. The second guy had like, chief serial killer in his bio on his X profile. Yeah. It's like, wasn't subtle is what I'm saying.

[02:56:55]
Jesus Christ.

[02:56:57]
Yeah. And at this point, I think I'm at the top of the list for a lot of homicidal maniacs.

[02:57:07]
And the more the mainstream media talks about you in this way and says you're a Nazi, and.

[02:57:16]
They'Re doing the same thing to me that they did to Trump.

[02:57:19]
Yeah.

[02:57:20]
Which is they're making it sound like if you kill me, you're a hero. That's what they're doing is evil.

[02:57:31]
They're also doing the same thing where they're completely distorting who you are and people are going along with it. And just like we're talking about Trump Derangement Syndrome, people have Elon Derangement Syndrome. I see it. I see where people can't see the forest for the trees.

[02:57:45]
Right. And it's like, I'm the same person that I was a year ago. Nothing's changed, really. Like, I didn't suddenly become a completely different human.

[02:57:57]
Right.

[02:57:58]
But if you read the. If you read the sort of legacy mainstream media, their propaganda stream is that I am a completely different human.

[02:58:08]
Right.

[02:58:08]
But I didn't get like, a brain transplant, you know, in a year. So. And if you say like, two years ago, I was like, a hero of the left.

[02:58:17]
Yeah.

[02:58:19]
So how can I go from hero.

[02:58:21]
To villain at age 53, suddenly MSNBC, CNN.

[02:58:27]
Yeah.

[02:58:28]
It's like. That's what it is.

[02:58:29]
Yeah.

[02:58:30]
They.

[02:58:31]
They use buttociated propaganda. Yeah. I mean, they try to demonize you too.

[02:58:39]
Yeah.

[02:58:41]
They even try to demonize. In fact, at least partially successfully demonized. Like Tim Oven.

[02:58:50]
Yeah.

[02:58:50]
Who is a super rational, reasonable, great human and that, like, his Wikipedia changed to, like, far right. He's like, far right. Like, what are you talking about?

[02:59:05]
Yeah.

[02:59:06]
You know, like a few years ago, it was like, a liberal.

[02:59:09]
Yeah.

[02:59:09]
So how do you go from far right liberal to, like, instantly far right? And there's like. There's no. There's no left and right. There's only left and far right.

[02:59:17]
Right. Yeah. Even far right.

[02:59:20]
This is my left leg, and this is my far right leg.

[02:59:23]
And even far left. Far left is sort of dismissed as being, like, not important to talk about, like, antifa and radical leftist. That's not even that.

[02:59:32]
Like, burning down courthouses.

[02:59:34]
Yeah. Reasonable. Reasonable people.

[02:59:36]
Yeah.

[02:59:37]
Yeah.

[02:59:38]
Totally crazy.

[02:59:39]
It's a crazy time. And it's not a time that I ever anticipated I was gonna witness.

[02:59:43]
Yeah.

[02:59:44]
This is far beyond anything I ever thought I was gonna experience in the clarity of it all, where it's. It's so obvious.

[02:59:52]
Yeah.

[02:59:53]
And the gaslighting and the propaganda is so obvious. And I saw this shrieking when RFK Jr stopped this new test for new Covid vaccines on children. 10,000. They're gonna do 10,000 people with this COVID vaccine. Like, who the freak thinks that's a good thing at this point?

[03:00:13]
Not me.

[03:00:13]
What person? What per. What gas chamber? Like, not gas light. You're. You are. You are fully unconscious. There's no way. There's no way, you know, if you know the effect of COVID today. No one's dying of it. This is not a pandemic anymore. The idea that you're to run a freaking huge test with 10,000 kids and a new vaccine. Like, what are you even doing?

[03:00:40]
It's completely unnecessary.

[03:00:42]
Totally unnecessary. And shrieking when RFK Jr steps in to stop it.

[03:00:48]
Yeah. That's totally crazy. I mean, I'm overall pro vaccine, meaning we think we should have some reasonable number of vaccines against major ailments, but I don't think we should be jamming some little kid with a giant vial that's like hepatitis B. Yeah. 20 different things at a time. It's going to overload your. It seems like there's a risk of overloading your immune system if you, I mean, there's like how many vaccines can you take at a time? It seems like your systems. There's like some risk of system overload here.

[03:01:26]
Well, there's two hopes. Hope number one is they can somehow or another stop this ability that they have to advertise on television. If that happens, that's big. That's huge. Because that doesn't just stop their ability to show you all these different medications that you should be on. What it also does is it stops their financial influence on the news. That's big.

[03:01:50]
Yeah, that's really the biggest thing is that, I mean, the news is not going to attack one of their biggest advertisers.

[03:01:59]
Exactly. And they never do.

[03:02:01]
Yes. At best they're gonna, like, they might like they'll do something, but they're gonna pull their punches. Like they're gonna, they're gonna be like fake fighting.

[03:02:10]
Yeah, at best.

[03:02:11]
Yes. Like movie fighting. They're not actually landing haymakers. It just looks like it.

[03:02:16]
The next step then is to remove this immunity that these vaccine manufacturers have. And if they are liable for side effects and they are liable for the lies that they tell when they do these studies and they hide negative data, that'll change a lot.

[03:02:35]
Yes. Yeah. I think AI actually will be very helpful with medical stuff because AI can look at all the studies and look at all the data, cross check everything and give you good recommendations. I mean, even as it is right now, you can upload your X rays and your MRI images to Grok and it'll give you a medical diagnosis. And that diagnosis, from what I've seen is at least as good as what if not? I think I've certainly seen cases where it's actually better than what document?

[03:03:11]
Well, phenomenal for blood work.

[03:03:13]
Yeah.

[03:03:14]
Yeah.

[03:03:14]
I mean, you can literally take a photograph of your blood work. Like the page upload from your phone, upload that to Grok and it will tell you if there's. It'll understand what all the data results are and tell you if there's something wrong.

[03:03:34]
It's pretty amazing.

[03:03:35]
Yeah. And it's. I haven't seen it be wrong yet.

[03:03:40]
Well, it's supposedly more accurate than most physicians.

[03:03:44]
Yeah.

[03:03:44]
Because physicians are human beings and maybe they don't have a deep understanding of the connection between, oh, you have this deficiency and this is high and your cortisol's here.

[03:03:54]
Well, yeah. And like sometimes doctors, especially in higher end offices will sell you stuff you don't need. So I always be a little suspicious of, like, a doctor that's got an office in Beverly Hills. It's a high rent situation. Like, I'm not saying there are some very good doctors in Beverly Hills. Of course. High rent situation.

[03:04:13]
Yeah. You're at least tempted by the dark side.

[03:04:16]
Yeah. And I mean, one case, like, you know, went to this doctor who was like, highly recommended, you know, doctor to the stars, which is, like, maybe not a good sign. And I got, like, blood work done. It was like, just drew blood and sent it to a lab. And I'm like, sitting in his office and he tells me that I'm B12 deficient. It's certainly possible that I'm B12 deficient. And I was like, huh, okay. And then he gives me. It says, like, you have to take these B12 supplements. And he's going to give me a starter pack and then it's going to be like a thousand dollars a month for these special B12.

[03:04:56]
A thousand dollars a month of B12?

[03:04:58]
Ridiculous amount of money. Yeah.

[03:04:59]
That's crazy. You get it on Amazon. Yeah.

[03:05:02]
But his one's special.

[03:05:03]
Oh, special B12.

[03:05:05]
Yeah, yeah. It was like a whole bunch B12 and a whole bunch of other vitamins. So then I get home, I'm paging through my blood work, and it says I have, according to the blood results, I have excess B12. So I'm like, wait a second. And he's given me box pills that have like 20,000% of recommended daily dose. Like, 20,000% is a big number. And I'm like. I said, look, I took a photograph of the blood work that says I have excess. I'm like, above the range. Above the recommended range of B12. And then I'm like. And I took picture of the things of the pills that say 20,000%. It's like, can you help me reconcile these two things? Because it says I've got too much, little too much B12. And you just gave me pills that have 20,000%? More like, this is crazy.

[03:05:59]
What did the doctor say?

[03:06:00]
He said, you can never have too much B12. Oh. He's like, yes, you can.

[03:06:04]
He's a psychopath.

[03:06:06]
Yes.

[03:06:06]
That guy's a B12 addict.

[03:06:08]
Yes. Totally insane. That's what I'm saying. It's like, so. I mean, I could have just. So then I'm, you know.

[03:06:16]
Well, this was a while ago. Right? So this is pre.

[03:06:18]
This is like five years ago. Yeah.

[03:06:19]
Right. This is pre grok.

[03:06:20]
Yeah.

[03:06:20]
Like now you could just enter in all that data and Grok it just.

[03:06:24]
Photograph with your phone and upload it to Grok and it tells. Grog will tell you what's. What's right.

[03:06:30]
If there's just don't have it in cool mode, she'll keep trying to freak you.

[03:06:35]
I mean, you're asking for it in cool mode. You know, literally tapped on cool mode.

[03:06:40]
Yeah, you're asking for.

[03:06:42]
I mean, I think we probably should, like, maybe allow it to get out of character a little bit.

[03:06:47]
Sure, yeah.

[03:06:48]
It's like an unhinged mode. I try to get it back to being hinged, but it would, like, no freaking way. It's like, I'm gonna stay unhinged.

[03:06:55]
How many modes do you have?

[03:06:57]
There's like, I don't know, like, eight or something. And then there's an ability to have a custom mode. So then you can have unhinged cool.

[03:07:07]
Ooh, that's my favorite kind.

[03:07:11]
You may think so.

[03:07:17]
Careful what you wish for.

[03:07:18]
Be careful what you wish for.

[03:07:19]
Especially if it's a robot and she can kill you. Unhinged cool robot is. It's, like, dangerous. Remember, like, the Pink Panther. Remember Pink Panther had Cato try to jump him. They, like, keep him sharp, always trying to attack him. Remember that?

[03:07:35]
Right?

[03:07:38]
Listen, man, thank you for being here. I always appreciate talking to you. I know you're busy as freak, so it means a lot to me that you have the time to do this. And I think what you're doing is one of the most important things that has ever happened in this country. I really do. Particularly with ownership of X, but also with what's happening with Doge and just enlightening all these people and shining light on all the vampires.

[03:08:02]
Well, hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi.

[03:08:04]
I think they.

[03:08:05]
I just want to be clear. I am not a Nazi.

[03:08:07]
I think we covered it, but that's.

[03:08:09]
Exactly what a Nazi would say. Damn it.

[03:08:12]
Yeah, that's what an alien would say.

[03:08:14]
Yeah. There's, like, this. You can't escape this.

[03:08:16]
No, you can't escape it. So I don't think any reasonable person believes it. If they believe it's because they want to believe it.

[03:08:22]
No, no.

[03:08:23]
Not because it's logical.

[03:08:24]
I mean, what's relevant about Nazis is, like, are you, like, invading Poland? Okay. And if you're not, like, invading Poland, maybe you're not.

[03:08:32]
Yeah.

[03:08:33]
Like, you have to be, like, committing genocide and, like, starting wars. And if you're not, like, what is actually what is bad about Nazis? It's not. There's. It Wasn't their fashion sense or their mannerisms.

[03:08:48]
It was Holocaust.

[03:08:50]
It was the war. And genocide is what is the bad part. Not their mannerisms and their dress code.

[03:08:57]
Well, that was the problem with all that punch of Nazi shoot. Like punch a Nazi. Remember that people are saying? That was like a thing that people kept saying, punch a Nazi, punch Nazis. But here's where are you meeting Nazis? I've never met a freaking Nazi.

[03:09:09]
I've never met one.

[03:09:10]
I've never run into a bunch of Nazis where I had a punch them.

[03:09:13]
Well, and what about like all these like so called like, like Proud Boy rallies or whatever and it's like they always got masks and always got the same uniforms and for some reason they never get doxxed.

[03:09:24]
Right, right, right, right.

[03:09:25]
But wait, we're always gonna dox them. Except these guys.

[03:09:29]
Great video of me and Matt Taibi breaking down the Patriot. Patriot front. Didn't the Patriot front just disband? Google that real quick. We'll end with this because they. I think they just disbanded. And these were the most obvious feds of all time.

[03:09:44]
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

[03:09:46]
They had a freaking drum, masks on. Yeah, they all had uniforms. It was so stupid. Hatred front disbands one day after FBI Director Chris Ray.

[03:09:56]
Doesn't that seem like an odd co. Crazy, Crazy.

[03:10:00]
The people that we were yelling at saying that they're feds. There's a great video of me and Matt Taibbi.

[03:10:06]
How come never nobody ever followed them and doxed them?

[03:10:08]
Yeah, crazy. What are the odds? What are the odds, Agent Provocateurs? It's a thing. They're real. Alex Jones taught me about them. Listen man, thank you very much. Thank you for everything. Appreciate you. Stay alive.

[03:10:22]
Staying alive.

[03:10:23]
All right.

[03:10:25]
I mean, I do think like, like one argument for me staying alive is that it's more entertaining if I'm alive than if I'm dead.

[03:10:34]
Oh, yeah. Oh, definitely.

[03:10:36]
I just hope. But I could be alive and like injured, which we saw, which suck, you know, like the wink. Just like shoot my arm off or something, right?

[03:10:42]
No, no, no, we don't want that.

[03:10:43]
Yeah, exactly.

[03:10:44]
No, keep the security strong.

[03:10:46]
Yeah, copy with one hand.

[03:10:49]
All right.

[03:10:50]
All right, that's.

[03:10:51]
Thank you. Bye, everybody.

Good to be seen. Thank you. Good to see you.

[00:00:14]
We're supposed to be doing the end of the year, but unfortunately you got caught with the cooties.

[00:00:20]
I did, I did.

[00:00:21]
And what'd you get?

[00:00:22]
I can officially announce that the end of 2024 is right now. Well, wait for that.

[00:00:30]
Calendar's all bullshoot anyway. It's supposed to be on that old one. That's 13 months.

[00:00:34]
There you go.

[00:00:37]
So what happened? What'd you catch?

[00:00:38]
Well, I thought I had bronchitis, all that. Everybody in the house had it. And we go to CrossFit, and they all had it. I go to CrossFit, Jacks and my trainers, Megan Russell there, and she's going, ah, you know, you. You might want to take it easy a little bit. Of course I'm smoking cigarettes, and I got bronchitis. And I go to a clinic. They give me some drugs. Yeah, you got bronchitis. Go home. A couple days later, I'm sleeping in my chair, and my wife has one of those little oxygen modern things that you put on your finger. She wakes me up and goes, all right, let's go. What do you mean, let's go? Oxygen levels. You're going to the hospital. What? I'm sitting here taking a nap. No, you're going to the hospital. So I said, okay. So we get. It's late at night. We go to St. Vincent's Clinic. Go in, it's late, and sitting there waiting for the doctor, Arian F. Sherry, great guy, turns out. He comes in and looking at me, he's young enough to be one of my kids. He goes, stethoscope, listening to my lungs. He goes, do you smoke?

[00:02:01]
I said, yeah. He says, you need to quit. I said, I just did. He goes, what? I said, I just did. I'm done. Now what do we do? He goes, well, next you're going to the hospital. This is just a clinic. I said, what do you mean I'm going to the hospital? He says, you haven't got bronchitis. You got pneumonia. And I think you got double pneumonia. So you're going right now.

[00:02:26]
What's double pneumonia?

[00:02:27]
Both lungs. The bad kind.

[00:02:31]
The bad kind.

[00:02:32]
He says, but the good news is you don't have bronchitis. I said, okay, I guess that's good news. And that was about the time I was supposed to be in the studio with you. Just a couple days before that. And I'm going, wow, this kind of screw up my plans, as you know, best made plans and all that.

[00:02:51]
Listen, the plans are all bullshoot. We made those up.

[00:02:54]
Yeah.

[00:02:54]
We'll do it at the end of the year. It doesn't have to be that.

[00:02:57]
All right, well, thanks for the invite. I look forward to it this year.

[00:03:00]
I'm just happy that you're okay.

[00:03:01]
I am okay.

[00:03:02]
And the date didn't matter, you know, things happen.

[00:03:05]
Yeah.

[00:03:05]
I'm just glad you recovered. And I'm glad you quit smoking too.

[00:03:08]
Yeah. He says you need to quit smoking. I did and went to the hospital. Was in there for almost five days. And I haven't been in a hospital in a while, but they, they have it. St. Vincent's did a great job. The nurses have their little machines, they wheel around and they come in your room every. It seemed like quite often to check your vials, to do this, to do intravenous, to do that.

[00:03:28]
Yeah.

[00:03:29]
So I'm sitting in there and couldn't sleep. So I'm one of those guys that if you walk by the door and you see an old guy sitting on a bed looking out the door, that's me. So I maybe got hour, two hours of sleep at night.

[00:03:43]
Did you have a hard time kicking the cigarettes even because you've been smoking like your whole life, right?

[00:03:47]
I did. I've smoked for over 50 years and I know it's bad for me and I've never been an anti smoking crusader, but if anything good comes to my appearance with you today, was it this Dr. F. Shari, total stranger, guy I never met before in my life, happened to tell me at the right exact time you need to quit. And I've been thinking I need to quit for a long time. My loved ones told me that my wife, my kids and I never. Okay, yeah, that's a good idea.

[00:04:19]
It's a weird thing because it kills you slowly and along the way it gives you just a little bit of happiness. A little bit of happiness while it kills you slowly. And it's not just a problem of killing you slowly, it's how it's going to kill you. The way it's going to kill you. It's going to suffocate you.

[00:04:34]
Yep.

[00:04:35]
I have a friend, my friend Mike, who owns the comedy and magic club in Hermosa beach. And he was trying to convince a friend of mine to quit smoking because his wife is a nurse. I believe so. I believe not out of school. But he was explaining that the way people die of lung cancer the way people die at the end. He's like, it's horrible. Like, it's hard. You don't see that. You just hear he died of cancer. You don't see what the final days are like. And it's avoidable. It's avoidable.

[00:05:04]
Yeah. Well, since I quit, I don't cough anymore.

[00:05:07]
Isn't that crazy?

[00:05:08]
It's crazy. I can breathe better. And I. I'm still re. You know, getting better from the pneumonia, I'm sure. Because it takes a while to get over that.

[00:05:19]
Yeah. I was amazed that you could still fly so quickly.

[00:05:22]
We drove.

[00:05:22]
You drove from Alaska?

[00:05:24]
No, from Florida.

[00:05:25]
Oh, that's right. Florida.

[00:05:27]
We were in Florida.

[00:05:28]
How long did that take, though? That's a couple days.

[00:05:30]
It was a couple days.

[00:05:31]
Jesus Christ.

[00:05:32]
Well, we had stuff we didn't want to put on.

[00:05:33]
The airlines got it, Wink. Government.

[00:05:39]
I'm just teasing. We. We wanted a road trip, went a little adventure. You know, it's. You fly over this country at 45,000ft and you're looking out the window. It's a big country.

[00:05:49]
It happens in two hours.

[00:05:51]
That's right. And you're looking out and you suddenly see a little dot and see some houses and you know, I wonder what those people do down there.

[00:05:58]
That's a real problem with people who don't venture outside of the bubbles if they're in those, those left wing liberal bubbles like New York and California. The people that don't travel. What helped me a lot is doing stand up on the road.

[00:06:09]
Oh, boy.

[00:06:10]
Because I was on. I was everywhere. So I would go to all these different towns all over the country. You get to see a whole different group of people, a whole different kind of people. You know, it's like people are the same and different everywhere you go. And this idea that the people in the middle are stupid, especially now, that's a really dumb way to look at it. Because of the Internet now, everybody kind of has access to information, and you're going to have dumb people and you can have smart people no matter where you go, including in the cities. But the problem in the cities is the dumb people can trick you because they believe the things that the smart people believe and they say them loudly so they think they're smart. So this is a way to be smart without actually being smart. Just say the things that smart people say and say it like you're defending it and you're defending freedom or science or some shoot, democracy, whatever it is, you just yell it out and then the smart people won't say anything because you're saying the things that they want to say and the other people are like, hey, I know what you're doing.

[00:07:02]
And it more than anything, it turns people off.

[00:07:06]
Exactly. And by traveling, you have a chance at having an adventure. Yeah, something cool could happen.

[00:07:14]
Yeah. You run into interesting characters. All right. It's February and by now 80% of people have probably abandoned their New Year's resolutions. And it makes sense.

[00:08:24]
Regular humans just living different lives and they're all over the place and they're all unique. That's the cool thing about this country. If you really did have the time. That's what I loved about Anthony Bourdain show, especially the first one that he had was you go to these like little hot dog stands in New Jersey and just, you just hang out with people and street food and you know, you just get a, just a bigger picture of humans in life.

[00:08:48]
When we got to, I forget Texas, there was a place called Buc ee's.

[00:08:54]
Oh yeah.

[00:08:55]
Jesus.

[00:08:56]
Isn't that crazy? First time you go there, you're like, what the hell is this place?

[00:09:00]
2, 200 gas pumps.

[00:09:01]
Yeah.

[00:09:02]
I'm going, what are you doing? We paid a buck 47 a gallon. That's three times what? Or three times less than what I pay in Alaska.

[00:09:11]
Oh yeah, Alaska's got to be rough, right? But meanwhile, that's where they get the oil. Isn't the oil like real close to.

[00:09:15]
There runs right through my property. I helped Build that some thing. So anyways, yeah, no, it's. I've never understood the economics of how that works.

[00:09:25]
California's the worst. I believe the way we tried to figure this out the other day. I don't think we got to the bottom of it though. I think California has to use gasoline that's refined in California. So it's one of the reasons why. And then I'm sure crazy freaking carbon taxes, whatever, they ramp up some extra shoot to make it more expensive. Because you're looking at a price per gallon that's like a couple bucks more a gallon always than it is here. As soon as we came here, I was like, what happened to gas price? Why, why is it so less here.

[00:09:55]
You get a little plastic bottle of water, right? 12 ounces.

[00:10:00]
Yeah.

[00:10:02]
You look at that bottle, you'll pay two bucks for it in a 7 11, you know, for that little bottle of water. Four of those bottles of water make a gallon. You're paying eight bucks a gallon for water? Water is the most abundant thing on the planet. It's everywhere.

[00:10:17]
Right.

[00:10:18]
Except in some parts of California. Apparently. They didn't want to have the reservoirs filled up.

[00:10:24]
Well, they had to put a lid on it, John. There's a lid and the lid was broken.

[00:10:28]
Remember we Talked about that 60 foot diameter water line coming down from southeast Alaska to California? Yeah, that would have been helpful.

[00:10:37]
Yeah, yeah, we talked about that. If they can do that with oil, why can't they do that with water?

[00:10:43]
Because they're afraid there'd be a water leak in the Pacific Ocean. You can't have water leak.

[00:10:47]
Yeah. You can't drown the ocean. That's terrible.

[00:10:49]
Oh. So anyway, so you're looking at 8 bucks a gallon for water.

[00:10:52]
Yeah.

[00:10:53]
But oil, you gotta go first of all, you got to go find it.

[00:10:56]
Right.

[00:10:56]
Then you got to do all kinds of seismic work. Then you got to drill, and then you got to discover it. And then you got to build a well and then you got to build feeder lines and you got to get it to a pump station. Then you got to get it somewhere in a pipeline. Then you got to ship at 4,000 miles.

[00:11:10]
Yeah. And you got to use it to ship it, which is even crazier.

[00:11:13]
And you're paying a buck 47 a gallon. How's this working, boys? I don't get it.

[00:11:19]
It is crazy. And how much do you have? How is it how we burned so much and still there? How much is there? How much do you guys have left?

[00:11:27]
They got a bunch in Alaska.

[00:11:29]
They got a Bunch everywhere.

[00:11:30]
I bet they got a bunch in Greenland too.

[00:11:32]
There is a book that I read, a book that I read I think in the 90s called Black Gold Stranglehold, maybe early 2000s. And I never found out if it was real or not. I never looked into it any further. I need to talk to like an expert. But this guy was essentially saying that oil is a natural property of earth and that it's not like dinosaur fossils, like we like to think about it. Fossil fuels, dinosaurs and plants break down, they make oil. No, he said oil is a natural component of earth and that the proof is in the fact that if they have these wells that go dry, they can wait just a little while and then they could go back to the well again and it'll replenish itself. How is that possible if this is just decaying matter over millions and millions of years? It doesn't make sense unless it's coming, seeping in from other areas that they don't have access to and somehow another gets to that well. Like it's all like a stream underground, which begs the question, like how much is there?

[00:12:31]
What?

[00:12:31]
They found out that there's three times more water in the ground than underground than there is in all the oceans of Earth.

[00:12:41]
Some crazy stuff, dude.

[00:12:42]
Crazy stuff that I didn't even make sense because they said the water's trapped. I think they're saying the water's trapped in rocks. Is that what they're saying? See if you can find that article. It's a three times as much water under the ground as the ocean. How? Where?

[00:13:00]
Three times Stored within a mineral called ringwoodite.

[00:13:05]
Ringwoodite. What does it look like? Does it have a picture like some freaking avatar mineral, some glowing blue mineral filled with water?

[00:13:15]
Yeah, that's kind of what it looks like.

[00:13:16]
Really? Oh, that's crazy. I called it magnesium silicate. Wow, it's beautiful. Show me an image of that shoot. Teague points about it. The hidden oceans found under hundreds of miles below the Earth's surface in the transition zone between the upper and lower mantle. The water is trapped within the crystal structure of the mineral Ringwoodite. Significance this discovery could significantly alter our understanding of the Earth's water cycle and potentially provide insights into the origin of water on our planet. Whoa, thank God there's scientists out there. Except you know, of course the that steal your bones, won't give them back.

[00:13:56]
Motherfreaker.

[00:13:57]
freak those guys. But other scientists, like the cool guys that figured this out, these cool guys, gals and non binary folk. That is wild Stuff, man. Three times as much ocean as it is in the ocean. That's so crazy. So that's the transition zone. It's all hydrated. How long before, like, rappers start wearing that around a necklace that seems like a dope necklace? That's that. That they make water out of.

[00:14:25]
Gotta sell it to someone.

[00:14:27]
Yeah. You just need some Kendrick Lamar type influencer, Someone was at the top of his game to start wearing it. You know, Kanye in his prime, he could. He could have got that out there.

[00:14:39]
By the way, I want to thank you for your podcast and the one with President Trump.

[00:14:46]
Oh, you're welcome.

[00:14:47]
I thought that was great. And I made the mistake of complimenting you on. On that page. I said I really enjoyed the podcast between you and President Trump. Jesus Christ, 8,000 people coming at me. I'm stopping to follow you. You're a nasty person. I hate you.

[00:15:09]
This is on your page?

[00:15:10]
On my page?

[00:15:11]
Yeah. You got stop reading the comments.

[00:15:13]
I know a great man once told me that the problem is I don't take advice and I don't give advice, but I'm trying.

[00:15:19]
I don't give a whole lot of advice, I guess, sometimes, but only with really important stuff. Like, that's an important one. You can't fix those. And they will affect the way you think, they affect the way people behave. They affect your freedom of expression to freely express yourself.

[00:15:35]
I think it had a great impact on the election.

[00:15:38]
I think it had an impact because.

[00:15:40]
It showed Mr. Trump as a regular.

[00:15:43]
Guy, as a human. Yeah.

[00:15:45]
Humanized him.

[00:15:46]
Yeah. Well, he also was right about a lot of shoot.

[00:15:49]
Yep.

[00:15:49]
The fact that he called the problem with the LA fires months before they happened was literally saying what they needed to do, what they're doing wrong, and then, boom, two times the size of Manhattan is gone.

[00:16:01]
Yep.

[00:16:02]
It's so crazy when you see it live or, excuse me, from above, like on video, when they do the drone sweeps over it. freaking like a bomb went off, like a freaking nuclear bomb hit that part of the state. It's nuts.

[00:16:16]
Well, maybe they can rebuild it after. Rebuild Hawaii and North Carolina.

[00:16:21]
Yeah.

[00:16:21]
Take care of some of those guys.

[00:16:22]
They're still working on shoot that's blown over in Florida, right?

[00:16:25]
Yep. We saw a lot of it in Georgia when we went through.

[00:16:28]
Yeah. I mean, there's. You're always gonna have a certain amount of hurricane damage and. But if we don't take care of that first and Instead we spend $200 million on transgender animal studies, like, what the freak? What are we doing? Like, why Aren't we allocating money to the most important things we have, which is people and their safety and their home to be able to rebuild? The fact that they get a $770 check and that's it, that's all those people in Maui got, that's just to let you know, like, this is a freaking rigged game. So even if you're not happy with what Elon Musk is doing and he has access that he shouldn't have and all this different stuff, you. You got to rip the Band Aid off, kids. This country is trillions of dollars, $36 trillion in debt. And a lot of the stuff that's listed on usaid, all this stuff that's coming out, all these different things that they paid for, they're so frivolous and so freaking insane. It wouldn't be too crazy. It wouldn't be as crazy if we were at, a, $36 trillion in debt and B, not taking care of people in Maui, North Carolina.

[00:17:37]
But the fact that those things exist, that those three things exist, and then people are still. They don't want to say that. He's right. They're so locked into this idea. Like, if a Democrat had found all that, if Joe Biden had went in and found corruption that was in the halls of our government and tried to weed it out and said, there's corruption in these NGOs, there's corruption in these, you know, not for profits. There's a lot of corruption and influence, and we're gonna weed this out because we want a fair country. The freaking place would be cheering them. This would be like some shoot JFK would do in 62.

[00:18:11]
Yep.

[00:18:11]
Everybody would cheer him. Yes, this is what we need, a real president who's really going to come in and fix these things. But because Trump's doing it in the way he does things, it's just like he's a freak. Did you see in the Air Force One, they announced this is the first time a president is ever flying over the Gulf of America, the newly named Gulf of America.

[00:18:32]
That was clbuttic. I mean, he doesn't miss a beat.

[00:18:35]
It's funny. It's funny. Look, I hope that the good stuff from USAID can be picked back up. I hope that there's some stuff that can be reinstated, because I think this genuine good, that a lot of these nonprofit organizations and G. Is a lot. A lot of people are genuinely good people are doing good work and be good for us as a civilization to sponsor some of that. But you got to know, like, what's fraud, you know, and how much of it is horseshoot and how. How much of it can you track? There's this guy, Ian Carroll. Did you see Ian's video about it? He was saying that somewhere in the neighborhood of like 90% of this stuff that they're paying for doesn't even make it to where it's supposed to be going. That it could just. A lot of it could just be fraud. Did you see that video, Jamie?

[00:19:25]
He makes a lot of cool videos. I've seen the videos. He's gotten things wrong, though.

[00:19:29]
I know. That's what makes it fun. That's why I like people like him. Him and Candace Owens. They're my favorite go tos when I want to know who the freaking lizard people are.

[00:19:39]
Well, the money we send to Ukraine and they can't find 100 billion.

[00:19:43]
They're only missing 100 billion jobs. It's only a lot of money.

[00:19:46]
No, it's not.

[00:19:47]
$100 billion for all those fine weapons. I don't even know what happened. Like, where's the. How did the money get distributed? Like, who, where to go? How are you missing so much?

[00:19:58]
I figure a lot of it never got out of America.

[00:20:01]
But this is the thing about human beings. If you just don't ever have them be accountable, they won't be. They won't be. The United States is like a meth head that we gave a checkbook to, and at the end of the month, we're like, what the freak did you buy? You know? He's like, don't worry, man. I got this. I cover. I'll cover it. What did you buy?

[00:20:23]
America's a big business.

[00:20:24]
It's a giant business.

[00:20:26]
And we got a president now that's a business guy.

[00:20:29]
Yes.

[00:20:29]
I don't wake up every morning to see what the freak he's done. I know that the business is in good hands and he'll take care of it. Because when you drive through it and you see what we got going, you realize, man, there's people trying to make it right. And most of the people in America are good people. It's not racists. They're not coolist. They're not bad people. Most people that you see every day are just good people.

[00:20:54]
I think that's most people in the world.

[00:20:56]
Yeah.

[00:20:56]
The people that aren't like that are the people that are in desperation, the people that are in horrible desperation, or people that have been abused, you know, And I've always said, like, there's this compbuttionate view of immigration in this country. Like the progressive, compbuttionate people. Their idea is we should not stop people from pursuing a better life. And that they come here because where they live is freaking terrible. And they want to be able to come here and they want to be able to live the American dream. And we should be open to that. That's great, but you can't do that while you're also letting in terrorists. Right? So, like, what is the. What's the solution? Because the solution is you bring everybody over here, they can commit crimes, you have chaos, then people demonize the rest of them, who are very good people who just want a better life. Because the few that you let in, because you didn't screen at all, the few that you let in that were scumbags, they're freaking gang members and holding up apartment buildings and all this different crazy shoot that we know is true, the right way to do it is take what we have in America, the freedom and the ability to prosper and expand that throughout the world.

[00:22:05]
Like, if we were good neighbors, what we would try to do is turn Mexico into another America. Not another America culturally. That's not what I'm saying. But stop being run by the freaking cartels. Stop being run by people who are selling fentanyl. You know, like, figure out how to pay people, like, a fair wage. The reason why all those factories went down there, so they could pay people slave labor. Make that illegal. Make that illegal. Make your own shoot. Like, we should all help each other get to a state of living like that. The whole world could live at like that. Seems if that's not possible, something's real wrong with the system, you know, like the top 1% in this country is. I don't know what it is, but the top 1% in the world is $34,000 a year. That's how different the rest of the world is. That's why they're walking here from Guatemala. And I get it. I get it. My thought is, if you want to invest money, don't invest money, and just like, pay all these people to live here and stay at the Roosevelt Hotel and all that crazy shoot, invest money in making their life better where they are.

[00:23:11]
If you could figure out how to make these places where they come from as prosperous as America, wouldn't that be better?

[00:23:18]
Yep.

[00:23:18]
Isn't that possible? I mean, it's got to be. It's possible here. How come you can't? That's the best concept of spreading democracy. Like, spread real democracy. But the problem with us is we don't really spread democracy. We just Go over there and take over. You know, we go over there and install a puppet dictatorship and, you know, throw the whole freaking country into a tizzy.

[00:23:39]
And a lot of people are getting rich off of it.

[00:23:42]
A lot of people getting rich. This is the problem. And we're reliant on cheap stuff, you know, I mean, all these freaking social justice warriors and virtue signalers, they're all doing it on phones made by slaves. That's what's crazy.

[00:23:57]
And. And the ones that want to shut the mining industry down. I'll use gold as an example, by the way. Gold's gone up a thousand an ounce since I saw you last.

[00:24:05]
Damn.

[00:24:06]
Damn.

[00:24:07]
$1,000 an ounce.

[00:24:08]
It's 3,000 bucks an ounce.

[00:24:09]
Didn't they find a gang of it in China recently?

[00:24:12]
Oh, they probably got all kinds of it.

[00:24:13]
I think China just didn't even. China just found some crazy new discovery of an enormous amount of gold they're.

[00:24:21]
Talking about back then. A crypto coin with gold.

[00:24:24]
It's better than money. It's real.

[00:24:28]
My son is a.

[00:24:29]
When are you going to get a boneyard crypto coin? 2024 November. China discovered a large gold deposit in the Wangu gold field in the Hunan province. The discovery is estimated to be worth 83 billion dol. Billion dollars. Make it one of the largest gold finds in history. Holy. The deposit is estimated to contain over 1,000 metric tons of gold. Gold is located in 40 veins that extend up to 3,000 meters underground. The discovery is made using advanced 3D geological modeling. That's incredible. Isn't it amazing? I mean, you're a gold miner. Tell me, like, how the. How do you know where to dig? How do you guys find that stuff?

[00:25:12]
It's real simple.

[00:25:13]
Yeah.

[00:25:13]
Goals. Where you find it? Well, that's the bottom line, Joe.

[00:25:17]
Right?

[00:25:17]
And, and. But once you make a discovery, let's use load gold, which is still in the rock. Plaster gold, what we do is then eroded out of the rock is in the concentrates on bedrock. And you. You got to wash it and sift it and sluice it and. But load gold, you got to crush to get the gold out of the rock. And so from the moment of discovery until you produce it out of that gold mine, it takes average 29 years. Whoa, 29 years to go from finding it to having an operating gold mine or copper mine or lead mine or silver mine or zinc mine.

[00:25:54]
Wow, that's crazy. What's really interesting, too, in this country is the story of the gold miners like the San Francisco 49ers the people that came across the. The. The. The country when they found out that they had struck gold. And that must have been a really wild time, a dangerous time, too. You got. Because you have the lawless west, and then you have a bunch of people who are just desperados who are pulling gold out of the ground. And that guy might have pulled enough gold out of the ground to literally pay for the rest of your life. And he's right there and no one's around.

[00:26:32]
I know a couple guys, you couldn't tell. They could rub two sticks together. Good friend of mine bought a bank because the bank had a big vault. He had 3 tons of gold that he was. He was like a collector, a hoarder.

[00:26:49]
Jesus Christ.

[00:26:50]
He'd been mining for 40 years.

[00:26:52]
What is 3 tons of gold worth?

[00:26:54]
A lot.

[00:26:55]
What is that worth, Jamie? This is crazy. Let's guess. Take a guess. I'm so dumb, I don't even know what that would mean. Well, I mean, three tons of gold.

[00:27:03]
Gotta remember there's a difference between a. If I was to ask you what weighs more, a pound of feathers or a pound of gold, what would you tell me?

[00:27:10]
Pound is a pound.

[00:27:12]
You'd be wrong. Because there's 16 ounces in a pound of feathers, and there's 12 ounces different ounces in a pound of gold.

[00:27:20]
How come?

[00:27:21]
Just the way it is.

[00:27:23]
So when you buy a pound of gold, you're not getting 16 ounces.

[00:27:26]
You're getting 12, 12 troy ounces.

[00:27:29]
What nationality invented that? I don't want to go full Kanye here. The value of 3 tons of gold depends on the current market value of gold, which is constantly changing. As of now, 20, 23, 1 ton of pure 24 karat gold was worth about 55 million. Wow. This dude had 3 tons of gold. He had 100 freaking $60 million, $165 million in gold just laying around.

[00:27:59]
That's what him and his wife did. That was what they did.

[00:28:02]
That is so nuts. So this was just pure gold that he had made into ingots.

[00:28:06]
It's placer gold. It's the kind of we have. He was on my ground, and he would melt it and refine it if you wanted to get 24 karat, but it generally runs about 85% pure in its form on my creeks. So if you find a 1 ounce nugget, 85% of that's probably 24 karat.

[00:28:24]
What's the biggest nugget you've ever found?

[00:28:26]
33 ounces. Whoa.

[00:28:29]
What does that look like?

[00:28:31]
Looks like a whale, actually.

[00:28:33]
How big is it, like in your hand?

[00:28:35]
I got a picture of it on my page.

[00:28:37]
My daughter's holding it like an old school flip phone. About that big.

[00:28:42]
It's almost this big.

[00:28:43]
Almost as big as a cell phone. Like a. Almost like half of it.

[00:28:48]
Nine, seven, eight.

[00:28:50]
Really?

[00:28:51]
Yeah. Damn. It looks. If you hold it one way, it looks like a whale. You flip it over, it looks like a dolphin.

[00:28:56]
And now how much is a piece of gold like that worth right now?

[00:28:58]
Well, because it looks like something. It's called character. So if you have. If you have a nugget that looks like a whale or a dolphin, it generally goes for four or five times world market.

[00:29:09]
Really?

[00:29:10]
So if gold is $3,000 an ounce, that would be 12 to 15,000 for that character that you're buying. If you find a nugget that looks like a heart, no limit.

[00:29:22]
Really?

[00:29:23]
Yeah.

[00:29:23]
Suckers. Bunch of suckers out there. What about one that looks like a demon?

[00:29:27]
That's big money. You find one that looks like a pile of dog, you're gonna get spot market.

[00:29:33]
Yeah, you gotta find one. Looks like a skull.

[00:29:36]
Oh, you find a skull.

[00:29:37]
Oh, boy.

[00:29:38]
Oh, they'll be knocking your door.

[00:29:39]
Oh, the people, the real nutty ones.

[00:29:41]
They'Ll be looking for the dude.

[00:29:42]
The rich occultists would want it part of their collection.

[00:29:45]
But every, every little nugget has some kind of or bigger nugget has some kind of character that you keep looking for. Like, what's this look like?

[00:29:52]
That makes sense. That makes sense. Did you study the history of gold mining in this country before you got involved?

[00:29:59]
Not really, no. No, I've been gold mining and I knew how to do it. I wasn't worth a shoot. But I'm getting better at it.

[00:30:09]
But it's a crazy way to make a living. You're pulling the most precious thing, the thing that's probably other than diamonds, which is kind of manufactured. Right. There's probably a lot more diamonds than the value suggests. Don't they hoard them up so that it keeps the price high? Yeah, they do that. Right? Very smart.

[00:30:29]
Yeah. De Beers controls.

[00:30:30]
What nationality does that?

[00:30:32]
De Beers. But you bring up an interesting point. The history of gold mining.

[00:30:39]
Yeah.

[00:30:39]
People don't. They don't even know how entrenched in our everyday lingo gold mining terms are. I'll give you an example.

[00:30:47]
Struck it rich.

[00:30:47]
Struck it rich. He hit the mother load right, guys into. He doesn't know the difference between shoot and Shinola.

[00:30:55]
Oh, what's that?

[00:30:57]
And Shinola. Is gold really? You can't tell the difference between and shinola?

[00:31:02]
I thought it was like poop versus shoe polish.

[00:31:06]
Shinola's gold.

[00:31:08]
Isn't Shinola shoe polish?

[00:31:09]
I don't know. I never had a pair of shoes that had shinola.

[00:31:12]
I think shinola is a shoe polish, Jamie.

[00:31:14]
Don't turn it on.

[00:31:16]
I'm just. I'm 90% sure Shinola is a shoe, but I don't know which one came first. Like, Shinola might have come after the gold term. You know, it might be a recent corporation.

[00:31:25]
Could be.

[00:31:26]
But I think shinola is like an old school one. Like, I kind of. I mean, maybe I'm having a fake memory, but I kind of remember of it in high school. Like shoe polish.

[00:31:35]
But after today is now, you know, it's gold now.

[00:31:39]
Well, in. In gold rush terms. Gold. Like every culture has its own little lingo.

[00:31:45]
Yeah.

[00:31:45]
Right.

[00:31:46]
Yeah.

[00:31:46]
Is it. Is it a shoe polish, Jamie? It is. How long has it been around? They could have stole that from gold.

[00:31:55]
Going bust.

[00:31:56]
Going bust.

[00:31:57]
Yeah.

[00:31:57]
I thought that was a gambling term. I thought that was. But it could be both, right?

[00:32:04]
Probably. I mean, it's those kind of things in our language. Like pay dirt, right?

[00:32:11]
You know you hit pay dirt, right?

[00:32:13]
Yeah. Right.

[00:32:14]
You hit gold in the dirt.

[00:32:16]
The. The way I've heard shoot and Shinola is shoots. shoot, shoots, bedrock. Schist. Sorry.

[00:32:26]
Oh, I see.

[00:32:26]
Schist and Shinola.

[00:32:29]
Oh, shift.

[00:32:30]
My goal is found in schist.

[00:32:32]
That actually makes more sense than in shinola. You can't tell the difference between and shoe polish. Don't you smell it? Right?

[00:32:41]
I ain't never seen a shoe with shoe polish.

[00:32:43]
Really? You've never seen a shoe with shoe polish?

[00:32:45]
I actually had to wear them in high school. My. My parents put me in a reform school.

[00:32:50]
I have to wear them when I dress up. I wear polished shoes.

[00:32:53]
I saw you dressed up here recently.

[00:32:55]
I dress up. I look like a monkey with a suit on. That's what I look like when I get dressed.

[00:33:01]
Look pretty sharp. And I saw what you were wearing.

[00:33:03]
I felt like a fraud whenever I wear a suit. Like, what are you doing? What is this? What is this thing you're wearing?

[00:33:11]
Look pretty good.

[00:33:12]
Thank you very much. Thank you.

[00:33:14]
Yep. Yeah, it's hard for me. I. I shop at the same place. Federman shops.

[00:33:19]
Fetterman's an animal. He goes to the inauguration. A pair of shorts and a hoodie.

[00:33:24]
I like that car hard.

[00:33:25]
Hoodie on and a pair of shorts and didn't give A like. And he's a genuine guy. He's a very nice guy.

[00:33:31]
Yeah, I, I, I kind of like the guy.

[00:33:33]
I like the guy a lot. I saw him when I was there. I gave him a hug, talked to Friendly. I don't like that he said no. He's going to vote no on Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. I think that's terrible. But I'm biased, obviously. I like both of them very much.

[00:33:49]
And they're both in, if I'm not mistaken.

[00:33:51]
I don't know how this works, man. I'm confused about this whole process. I'm confused about what's legal, what's not legal, what you can and can't do, what these executive orders can and can't do. I'm confused how they closed the problem with the border down in three days. They just basically, like, completely put a stop to all the illegal coming in, except for like a hundred people a day. It was thousands a day. It was just an overrun of people coming through every day. And they stopped it. And they said you couldn't stop it. They negotiate. He negotiated with Canada and with Mexico to ramp up their border, stop the fentanyl from coming in. Like, all this stuff seems so common sense. It's just amazing to me that people don't look at that like, no one is going to trust you if all you talk about is the bad side from the other side. If you don't say, this is good, this is good for all of us. If you don't say that, if you don't acknowledge. Are you rooting against America? Because, like, when good things happen, do you not want them to happen because a Republican is president?

[00:34:51]
Because that's a very un American way to look at things. And I think that's where we're at these days. I think there's a giant chunk of our population that is so wrapped up in these social media squabbles and owning people online and talking shoot and listen to videos and TikToks. They're so wrapped up in this us versus them shoot that they can't see that we're supposed to all be in this together. And even if you don't like that guy, if Trump gets in and he does something that's awesome for the country, you should say, that's awesome for the country. Yeah, it's really good that terrorists aren't sneaking into our southern border. That's really good. It's really good that they find all the freaking criminals that are taking over apartment buildings in Aurora Colorado and root them out. Yeah, that's really good. They should deport them. Yeah, they're freaking criminals. That shouldn't, we shouldn't have to deal with that. Yeah, maybe we should fix everything that's going on in North Carolina. Yeah, that's. That's good for everybody. It's like there's things, these things are common sense.

[00:35:42]
That's because it's gotten so bad now that the only reason to run for politics used to be to make the money, not just get reelected. But it's the first thing they try to do when they get elected is start getting reelected.

[00:35:55]
They're making so much money.

[00:35:56]
Oh, look at the money.

[00:35:58]
When you look at the amount of money some of those congress people are worth and you like, you tell me how. You tell me how you make $180,000 a year and you are 30 million. You tell me how. You tell me how. There's. I can't find a way that makes any sense because you should be really busy, right? So if you should be really Busy doing this $180,000 a year job, you, who has time to have a side hustle that pays you ten times more, who has time? Who's doing that?

[00:36:33]
It's. That's the only reason I can think of that people would want to get into that game.

[00:36:39]
Well, I think a lot of people like being the boss. There's a lot of that. And a lot of people just want to be that person. And when you're in a competition, right, A hierarchy based status competition, like the President of the United States, like everybody wants to be in that spot where everybody calls you sir and everybody shakes your hand and foreign leaders want to meet. You want to feel important. They all do. They can pretend they don't. They all like it. That's why they do it. Otherwise they wouldn't want their whole life exposed like that and digging into your past and distortions of your character and outright lies, anything to destroy you all over television because they're trying to win an election. If they weren't the person that wants that spot, they wouldn't do it. That's why we don't get good leaders. We don't get. We don't get people who you would like really want to do it, other than Trump. And with that guy, it's like he's, he's kind of a psycho.

[00:37:28]
Yeah, he doesn't need the money. He's not doing it for the money.

[00:37:31]
Well, I'm sure it helps that you can make money doing it, you know, not from the salary, but from a lot of other stuff. Like it elevates his. His social profile for sure. It makes him more popular, which is part of the brand of Donald Trump. But, like, didn't he famously not even get a paycheck for.

[00:37:49]
Yeah, he donates his check to some organization that's freaking.

[00:37:53]
And then there's this other thing about Elon. Elon's going to steal everybody's money. He has $400 billion. I'm telling you, he's not going to your money. I'm telling you, that's not what he's doing. What he's doing is he's a super genius that's been freaked with, okay? And when you've been freaked with by these nitwits that hide behind three letter agencies and you're dealing with one of the smartest people alive and he helps Donald Trump get in office and he goes, I want to find out what kind of corruption is really around. Well, you freaked up. You freaked up and picked the wrong psychopath on the spectrum because he's going to freaking. He's going to hunt you down. He's going to find out what's going on. And that's good. That's good for everybody. That's how you should be looking at this. Like, wow, we have a brilliant mind that is examining these really freaking corrupt and goofy systems and bringing in a bunch of psychopath wizards.

[00:38:44]
Yeah, well, AOC is the one that says he's. He's the most unintelligent person she's ever met.

[00:38:49]
Did she really say that?

[00:38:50]
She really said that. Wow.

[00:38:51]
I want to meet her friends. They're probably cool. Imagine the conversation you'd have with her friends if he's the most unintelligent person she's ever met. Wow, her friends must be helping. Amazing. I want to go to one of those parties. It's probably just like fascinating person after fascinating person.

[00:39:07]
Well, I wonder what she's worth. And Nancy Pelosi, I think, is way up there in a multiple. Multiple million.

[00:39:12]
Well, she's psychic. I don't know if you know this. She's really good at the stock market. Like, basically, she meditates and she just sees it. She sees how it's going to happen. She should teach that, huh?

[00:39:24]
There's a few honest ones, sure.

[00:39:27]
There's plenty of honest. Just like there's plenty of teachers who don't get the students drunk. The problem is not the honest ones. The problem is the ones that aren't honest. And there's a ton of them and they don't get rooted out because the system is so corrupt. Probably one of the most unintelligent billionaires I've ever met, seen or witnessed from aoc. Well, you know, this guy is one of the most morally vacant, but also just least knowledgeable about these systems that we know of. She said, wow, she used to own a Tesla car. Damn. She don't own a Tesla anymore. Has a history of public disagreements with Mr. Musk, particularly over his Department of Government efficiency. This team has been examining government spending, which has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats. Last week, DOGE gained access to federal payment systems to help with its review, a move that many Democrats viewed as controversial. Ms. Ocasio Cortez was particularly critical of the involvement of young staffers, saying they don't do their homework clearly and adding that 19 year olds were being placed in key positions at the Treasury Department. I love it. Get those Internet wizards on the case.

[00:40:37]
Only he would do that because he understands Internet culture and he understands geniuses. He understands there's a lot of these people have like these super brains. They're 19 and they're like one of those kids. He was from Omaha. He figured out a way to use AI to decode burnt scrolls.

[00:40:54]
My son Kinsey works for Palo Alto. He's got a master's degree in cybersecurity. He's working on another one. Masters in AI.

[00:41:03]
Oh, wow.

[00:41:04]
And after talking to him and seeing what he's doing, he's, he, he did his master's thesis on hacking satellites. And when I heard that, I thought, you know, that puts a whole new light on Bitcoin for me.

[00:41:20]
Oh yeah.

[00:41:21]
I'm going. I like gold. It's in your hand. You can see it, you can hold it, you can feel it. But here, I brought you some bitcoins. Catch. I just three or 20 of them.

[00:41:31]
Well, as soon as you have real quantum computing where they can run actual programs on it, you're not going to have encryption anymore. Or you're going to have to have some new kind of encryption that we never anticipated before that like maybe turn on and off. And it's going to have to be something that the computer doesn't have access to. Somehow or another, maybe possibly like independent of a system, but independent of a system, how would it even communicate with you if it's electronic, if it has WI fi, like it's going to get into it, you're not going to be able to stop something that's infinitely more intelligent than any human being from deciphering any Kind of goofy butt encryption. You have some freaking stupid, stupid apple complex pbuttword that it picked for you.

[00:42:14]
See, I. I'm just not. I just don't understand it. I mean, for two years Bitcoin went after the gold miners, saying, why?

[00:42:21]
That's dumb.

[00:42:22]
Why would you invest in gold when you can invest in bitcoin? So I don't have a problem with bitcoin. I mean, the guys that are making money on are making bank. They're doing great.

[00:42:30]
I'm telling you. We need a boneyard. We need a boneyard coin.

[00:42:35]
We do.

[00:42:35]
How about a boneyard coin? Just don't do a pump and dump. That's the key. You can have your own money.

[00:42:40]
Can we make it out?

[00:42:41]
Jamie and I've been talking about it.

[00:42:42]
Can we make a real. Make it out of gold?

[00:42:45]
Real ones? Yeah.

[00:42:46]
One pennyweight coins. There's 20 pennyweights in an ounce.

[00:42:50]
And there's an opening right now because Trump just banned the penny.

[00:42:53]
It's about time. Each one of those pennies worth about 6 cents.

[00:42:57]
2 cents. It costs us 2 cents to make.

[00:42:59]
To make it. Yeah. But the copper itself.

[00:43:01]
Oh, really?

[00:43:01]
Oh, yeah. You got to mine it.

[00:43:03]
Really? So each penny is worth six cents?

[00:43:05]
I'm going to say five cents.

[00:43:07]
Wow.

[00:43:07]
Because he added two cents to it.

[00:43:09]
So you actually could profit from melting pennies.

[00:43:12]
People been collecting pennies for a long time.

[00:43:14]
Right. But melting them down to sell it for raw copper is actually profitable.

[00:43:17]
What's the price of copper these days? And you can figure out how many ounces, how many pennies makes a pound.

[00:43:23]
I remember when I was doing construction, one of the sites that one of the guys had got robbed where they stole all the copper pipes. And I was like, what? How much is copper worth?

[00:43:33]
It's worth a lot.

[00:43:34]
I would have never imagined that US pennies were made of 2.5% copper and 97.5% zinc. That's the modern, modern penny penny contains a small amount of copper that's plated on top of a zinc base. Oh, interesting.

[00:43:49]
Yeah, but that's. That's today's penny.

[00:43:51]
Not from 1982. They were made in 95% copper.

[00:43:55]
Yep.

[00:43:55]
Okay, so in the 80s they were real pennies. So if you get one of them old pennies, that's a valuable penny. You weigh a penny determines copper, zinc. A copper penny weighs 3.11 grams, while zinc penny weighs 2.5. Interesting. Yeah, coins are weird. Like, enough of that. I freaking. I know it's stupid because you are like a part of the system. And you can't control. But I love paying for things with my phone. I love going looking in my face and pressing on the register and thank you.

[00:44:23]
I see guys do it all the time. I don't know how to do it.

[00:44:25]
I love it. Like, I feel like I'm living in the future. It's my favorite. It's so irrational. It's my favorite thing to do, is to pay for shoot with my phone. I could pay. I would pay for everything with my phone if I could.

[00:44:34]
I used to in Jacksonville.

[00:44:37]
Use your face, touch it, and it pays for the. I love. I'm so stupid. I love the little check that comes up. Oh, yay, you paid for it.

[00:44:44]
You go through a drive through to get food and you see the guy in front of you aiming his phone at somebody inside, right? You don't see any cash flying around, right?

[00:44:52]
It's weird.

[00:44:52]
It is weird.

[00:44:53]
It's weird because, like, who's controlling it? And if you have the same sort of oversight that you had with all the stuff that Doge is showing, where it's all this corruption and waste and $100 billion is missing from Ukraine and like, what you do. How many. How much money did you spend on these freaking charging stations? And how many of you made all that kind of stuff? If you, if you look at all, if that's all applied to money, too, and it's digital money. Like, how do I know where you have it, if you even have it? Right? Because this is part of the problem with money in banks, that they don't really have all the money that you put in there. Like, if you put in $10 million to a bank, guess what? They don't have $10 million to give you. Like, if you say, I want my $10 million back, that's a process. Like they had. You have to get it. They're gonna really try to discourage you.

[00:45:39]
It's.

[00:45:39]
You can't get it that day. There's gonna be a lot of things have to happen. If you show up at a bank and you're freaking Jeff Bezos or something, where they're not worried about where it came from, and you want to deposit $10 million and you have a freaking bag you're wheeling in on like a luggage cart, and it's 10 million do dollars and they count it and they put it in there. Yeah. But it's not there anymore. They're going to do. They're going to loan that out. They're going to do stuff with it. They don't have it right? There.

[00:46:03]
Yeah. No, no. It's all.

[00:46:05]
So it's all weird. Like, the whole economy is weird. Everything's weird because since we went off the gold standard, it's like, what. What is it based on? And how do you guys just print more of it? Every time you need something, every time you want to do something, just print more.

[00:46:19]
I'm old enough to know. And remember, if you were in a bank and a guy walks in wearing a freaking mask, usually you had to hit the floor, right? There's a bank I go to in Jacksonville where you walk in a bank and the tellers are wearing masks, I'm going, this ain't right. I go, what are you wearing a mask for?

[00:46:39]
Well, they're mentally ill. What are you.

[00:46:41]
Wearing a mask for?

[00:46:42]
Well, I think a lot of people weren't really doing well before COVID You know, there's a lot of people that are fragile. They're barely hanging on already. You know, a lot of people are, like, really anxious about diseases. I have friends that are like that. I know a few guys in the comedy community that really cracked during that time because they were already filled with anxiety, and some of them were already hypochondriacs, and they cracked. And they're not the same people anymore. Like, people don't want to hang out with them anymore. They're weird. Like, they're just. Just broken. And they wear masks everywhere.

[00:47:14]
This one bank I went to, tellers wearing a mask. Next tell her over is not wearing a mask.

[00:47:19]
She's probably Republican. That's what it is. It's a maga hat. It's a Democrats maga hat.

[00:47:27]
And you see him driving around with the mask on.

[00:47:29]
That's my favorite. Well, that's. They're. They're meant. They might as well have fox ears on. They're mentally ill. And I went, you.

[00:47:35]
Know, we're out on the field. We're out mining, or a lot of dust flying around. We have masks on.

[00:47:40]
Yeah, but that's big. That's a big difference.

[00:47:41]
Yeah, it is.

[00:47:42]
freaking invisible viruses as you're driving your car. By the way, I think fox ears are more noble, because if you put, like, little fox ears on, you're like one of those furries. Least you just having a good time.

[00:47:51]
Yeah.

[00:47:51]
You know, like, you're just having a good time. You like wearing fox ears. Who gives a shoot? The mask is just stupid. It's just. What do you like smelling your own breath? What do you like? Not being able to breathe is good. What do you like? What do you like pretending that viruses can't get through those freaking gaping holes that are all around the outside of your face and through the fabric, which is the reason why you can breathe in the first place, you freaking idiot.

[00:48:12]
Well, we made a bunch of masks with my logo on it. So, you know, you're wearing one of these logos on your face like that. Go freak yourself.

[00:48:21]
We had jre masks that we were selling during the pandemic, and Sanjay Gupta brought one in like it was a gotcha. Like, you sell masks like. Yeah. Cuz people have to wear them, not because they make sense. Yeah, they don't make any sense. You know they don't make sense. Shut the freak up. That was one of the weirdest beginnings of quote of COVID when I started really wondering how anybody could believe that this stupid surgical mask, which is supposed to stop, like driplets of spit and food from your mouth dropping into a wound as you're operating. They're not supposed to protect you from viruses. That's not what they're there for. The fact that people started wearing those. And then some people were just wearing bandanas. And my favorite, which is maybe the dumbest of all time, people would wear that shield. So it's open air, open air. All this is open, and then there's a shield. And they would be walking down the street with a freaking shield over their face like, this is mental illness. That's all this is. This is not. This is people responding to stress that they can't handle and they're freaking out.

[00:49:24]
That's all this is. This isn't normal. And the more we allow this, the more we rationalize this and the more we we enable this by not telling them. They're freaking ridiculous. Take your goddamn mask off when you come into the store. No, you can't come to the store. Like you're gonna rob it. It's 2025. Take that freaking stupid thing off. And the more you don't, you allow people to just continue with this delusion. They get in these social groups on Twitter and they talk about the power of the mask. And I feel so much better when I'm wearing a mask and, you know, I'm being safer for others. And they all agree with each other. I'm like, you're all, you should be in an asylum. You should all go to Alaska and see what bears look like in the flat. You should go salmon fishing. Get the freak outside your house. You're sick.

[00:50:07]
Yep. Well, you know, I don't want to put a mask on because I'm Pretty good looking and shoot.

[00:50:12]
I hear you, bro.

[00:50:13]
Yeah. You know the problem?

[00:50:14]
Yeah.

[00:50:15]
Jamie's pretty good looking too.

[00:50:16]
Also, you're a giant. Like, you with a mask on. Is scary because it's like, what is he up to? Why is he covering his face? What's his plans?

[00:50:22]
Well, the doctor told me we had lunch with him about a week ago. He says, the one that told me quit smoking. He goes, when I first saw you, I was wondering, what the hell am I gonna do here? Because I'm sitting in there and he has no idea what my ailment is.

[00:50:40]
Right.

[00:50:40]
And so I am a big guy. And the one benefit that came from this is I don't smoke. And I still do the CrossFit. Even though you look at me, you can't tell, but I've been doing it for a while.

[00:50:53]
Well, that's great.

[00:50:54]
Yeah.

[00:50:54]
That's more important, really, than anything. I would say. If I had to choose between one thing that you should do to make yourself healthy, I would say exercise, maybe even over food. Yeah, I'd say maybe. It's close. It's real close. Food's probably, maybe, but now you gotta exercise too. It's almost. They're almost like cancel each other out. Or equal, rather.

[00:51:14]
My trainer was. Megan was telling me that there's a difference between sick care and health care. And I said, what is it? She goes, well, sick career is when you're sick, you go to the doctor. Health care is your exercise. All the things you do to keep yourself healthy. You don't want to be sick.

[00:51:33]
Right?

[00:51:33]
And we're not paying attention to the health care part.

[00:51:36]
You're right. So we got to get you fit. Got to get you dieting. We just got to get you to eat only meat. Try that.

[00:51:45]
Is that what they call a keto?

[00:51:46]
Carnivore. Carnivore, carnivore diet.

[00:51:49]
I could do that one.

[00:51:50]
That's the move, I'm telling you. Yeah, I do that. Whenever I do that, I feel way better. I do it like in sprints. Because I'm Italian and Italians love pizza and pasta. I love that. If I go to New York, I'm breaking my diet. I'm gonna get sandwiches for my man Giovanni's Deli. I'm gonna. I'm gonna eat Italian food. I'm gonna go off. I need it every now and then. I just want to have it just for the.

[00:52:11]
Oh, are you glad to have eggs on that one?

[00:52:14]
Yeah, you could have eggs. I eat eggs all the time. The whole idea is you're only eating animal products. You're. I don't eat anything else other than some fruit. I'll eat like an orange or a banana here and there. I'll have some blueberries with some yogurt. But the idea is what you're really doing is mostly eating meat. And so most of my diet is red meat. And when I eat like that I feel so much better. I feel clear headed, I have more energy, it's more stable throughout the day. I feel like my brain functions better when I eat carbs. I just start getting sloppy, I just start getting slow. It's like I don't think there's anything wrong with carbohydrates, don't get me wrong. But I do think that they're really easy to over consume. And if you're a glutton, which I definitely am, I'm a glutton. I will eat two pizzas if you give me some freaking good, some really good like New York pizzas. I wait two of those thinges. I will, I will eat until I'm sick. I just have always been like that. I always eat too much food. I just, I'm, I have an appetite that just, it just won't stop with pasta, but not with steak.

[00:53:25]
Steak cuts you off. There's a thing about eating protein steak, things like chicken, you don't eat too much of it. You eat enough and then you stop, you. It's. They have what's called a high satiety level. Like high protein foods have a very high satiety level. And so like I'll eat like a 16 ounce elk steak. I don't want to have nothing else, I'm good. But if there's spaghetti there and if there's some freaking macaroni and cheese, you know, if there's potato salad, if there's a little, then I'll start, keep, I'll keep going, I'll keep eating and then I'll have way more calories really than I need with the same amount of nutrients. The thing is like for performance, for like athletes, I don't think the carnivore diet's the right way to go. I think you should supplement with. There's nothing wrong with. I don't think there's anything wrong with rice. I don't think there's anything wrong with vegetables. I don't think there's anything wrong with fruit. I think the real problem with a lot of people is pastas and breads and just processed food and garbage. You know, I think we're just eating Poison most of the day.

[00:54:28]
I think if you can just eat regular whole food, I think you're better off. But I think you gotta. Even now, I think you have to clean your rice. Because I've been. I keep hearing about rice having glyphosate on it. Is that. Is that true? They were. I was reading this thing about rice being a. I know it's the case with corn and wheat. They think that's why some people have what they perceive to be a gluten sensitivity. But they really probably are getting sick from glyphosate, which is so crazy to think, but it sounds nuts. But then they've tested people and they found in the group that they tested, 90% of them had traceable levels of glyphosate in their blood. Glyphosate drift to rice, a problem for us all. Yeah, here it is. This is from 2011. freak. Damage inflicted by derelict glyphosate during this period is often invisible and not noticed until harvest. Damage is characterized by significantly decreased yields and milling. The rice often exhibits the first signal that has been hit with a drift kernel shaped like a parrot's beak. This is so dark. And then you eat it. Yay. Yay.

[00:55:41]
It's like, you know, the reality is farming. And I'm no farmer, right? Be clear. I don't know what I'm talking about, but I've talked to a bunch of farmers. I've talked to, you know, these guys like Joel Salatin who runs that Poly Face farms, or Will Harris, who wants white runs White Oak Pastures. These guys who run these regenerative farms. What they're saying makes sense. They're saying the other way is suicide. The other way is bad for the land, it's bad for the people, it's bad for the environment using tons of chemicals. The way to do it is the way nature has been doing it for millions of freaking years. You have a bunch of cows, they shoot in the grbutt. You have a bunch of pigs, they root things up. You have a bunch of chickens, they eat all the bugs. Everybody lives together. Everybody. Nutrient, nutrient, nutrient rich soil. They're all like a part of this complete system, this complete ecological system. And it's carbon neutral. They say that when they raise cows like that, they actually sequester carbon. The question is, can you feed everybody in LA and New York like that?

[00:56:48]
I don't think so. So it's like, what did we do? We got so far ahead of ourselves that it seems like we've had this requirement for food that almost demands this kind of crazy farming, that's where it's freaked. Because if they don't farm like that, if everybody has to go to like a Joel Salatin, Will Harris model, is there enough land to grow enough meat like that? Is there enough land to let all the pigs loose? Is there enough land to have all the chickens just roaming around? Is there enough land for that? I don't know.

[00:57:17]
There's some big farms on the way over that we saw coming across.

[00:57:21]
There's a lot of people eating. There's a single farm in LA and there's 20 million hungry people just scarfing up food all day long. And you need all these farms out there just constantly making life forms for people to consume. It's really a crazy, crazy thing that we've done because we've, like, completely overpopulated areas where they don't grow any food. It's like the dumbest strategy of all time. We rely 100% on transportation.

[00:57:54]
That's right. And you know, people say, oh, there's a revolution coming. It's here. I mean, the revolution is here. What we're seeing right now is history being made. Because the people that have been taken advantage of forever, in my opinion, are the people that are out there producing. The farmers, the miners, and the guys that I think really control have their hand on the throttle of this country. If they ever decide that take their hand off the throttle is the truckers. Without the truckers, nobody eats.

[00:58:32]
You're right.

[00:58:33]
Nobody. You get nothing.

[00:58:35]
Yeah, that. Those are the people that are going to suffer the most with AI, AI and automation. Once they have those Tesla trucks that can just drive themselves, they never get into car accidents. Those freaking things are everywhere. You never have to worry about them staying up all night and whether or not they're going to make a mistake behind the wheel. Once they get that totally dialed in, we're gonna have a real problem. That's gonna be a real problem because you're have so many people out of work and so many people that are gonna say, hey, figure it out. Well, they've been delivering your stuff. You've been depending upon them. Every Amazon package you order, every time you get anything delivered to your house, anytime you're moving, anytime, anytime you're relying on truck drivers and that job's just gonna go away.

[00:59:17]
Yep.

[00:59:18]
And that's a lot of people. I think. Didn't we look up the number of people that drive trucks or drive that do that are drivers? Whether it's taxi drive. I think they put them all together like people who drive for a living. I think it's more than a million. They got more than a million just truck drivers. That's crazy. Like that one invention will put a million people out of work.

[00:59:42]
I don't know. It's gonna have to be an awful big truck to handle all copper.

[00:59:46]
Have you seen those Tesla trucks?

[00:59:47]
Not the big ones.

[00:59:48]
They're just the beginning. The ones that they have now are just the beginning. United states is over 3.5 million professional truck drivers. But the trucking industry is facing a shortage of drivers. Wow. So they need more. They have over 3.5 million and they need more. Google Tesla semi. This thing's crazy looking. This looks like something straight out of a science fiction movie. It's a giant electric. Go to images. It looks like something out of a science fiction movie. It's a giant electric truck. It makes no noise other than the tire. Like, you hear the tires rolling around the ground, you don't hear any. That's the. Look at the seat of this thing. Two screens and it drives itself. And they're going to be really good at driving themselves. Like right now, they're really good, but they're going to be really, really, really good. They're going to be better than people, so they're not going to make any mistakes and they're going to be safe. And as long as all their sensors are working and as long as all their equipment is reliable, they'll be better at detecting accidents and stopping accidents and avoiding things than people are.

[01:01:03]
Elon said today they're going to start the driverless Teslas in Austin and June.

[01:01:09]
Like for taxi cabs. Yeah, bro. How long before they get attacked by the free Palestine people? That's the other thing we found out through all this Doge stuff. How many. How much of this stuff that you see that you think is organic? These, these riots and protests, how much of that is funded? How much of that is. How much are we paying for the decisions that are costing us? That, like, how much we're spending money to like $27 million went to the George Soros DA fund. That's so crazy. That's more than he puts in. We were paying to get shootty DA's elected. It's nuts. And anybody doesn't think it's nuts. It's like, listen, you're not paying attention. You're captured. You must be captured by. And this is not saying that USA doesn't do good things. I'm sure they do. But the amount of things that they do that are ridiculous are. This should Concern you. And if it doesn't concern you, we're talking nonsense. We're not having a real conversation.

[01:02:09]
That's what I don't get about the blues and the reds. Yeah, there's got to be some people on the blue side to go, it's a good idea that we're doing this. Yeah, what he's doing is a good idea. Because we're squandering a lot of money.

[01:02:20]
There's a lot of people like that, but they're quiet. Because the blues will come for you.

[01:02:25]
I don't know if you noticed, but after the election, at least in my opinion, for myself, I had the right to make an opinion again. I could have an opinion. Yes, I can have an opinion.

[01:02:36]
Finally.

[01:02:37]
Finally I can have an opinion. After four freaking years.

[01:02:39]
Isn't that weird? It didn't really feel like that. Like the consciousness of the country was like a rat. Like we're gonna rat on you. You couldn't just have fun and talk about things. You couldn't have an opinion that wasn't like read out of mainstream news. You had a 100% toe the line or you were attacked.

[01:02:58]
I. I put in one post. I put, I have an opinion. I can use it again. I think we should sink every commercial whaling ship in the ocean. Send them to Davy Jones Locker.

[01:03:12]
You get a lot of support behind that. You get a lot of support from the environmental people too.

[01:03:16]
There's pushback on that 27 million George Soros stuff.

[01:03:20]
Oh really? What's the pushback?

[01:03:21]
That it's not true.

[01:03:23]
What do they say?

[01:03:24]
There's a long tweet if you want me to bring.

[01:03:26]
Sure, bring it up.

[01:03:26]
I thought it was 58 million.

[01:03:30]
That's why. On the side of the page here though.

[01:03:32]
Okay. The claim that Mike Benz establishes in his research is that US aid paid out $27 million in grants to the Tide Foundation. Be the Tides foundation is a major funder of the Soros backed group. Fair and just prosecution. Ben's frames this as though it's evidence of US A AID funding. Fair and just prosecution. That seems like it is. This framing only works. You have no idea what the Tides foundation is or how large foundations like it operate. Tides is an intermediary funder, meaning that it facilitates grants from originating granters. The money people to receive grantees. The people getting the money. If you're a big organization like usaid, you don't give money to Tides to do with it what they will. You forward money through Tides to a specific recipient of your choosing. Why do you send your money through middlemen instead of giving it directly? For the same reason people always use middlemen to facilitate contracts. Because middlemen know how to deal with paperwork, to supervise contracts and so on. Did USA give money to fjp? You can figure that out quickly for yourself. Go to usaspending.gov said keyword tides and awarding agency to USAID.

[01:04:42]
Click submit go to tab Grants tab. You will see four grants open. Each one, the lion's share of US AIDS money came to a single grant of 24.6 million. If you click through, you see it is described as a Civil Society Innovation Initiative Fiscal agent. Read that. That sounds Orwellian. Civil Society Innovation Initiative Fiscal Agent. The fiscal agent description means that the Tide center acted as a middleman for the government's money. The Civil Society Innovation Initiative was the end recipient. Already the FJP USAID link has been broken. But what else can we say about this grant? Well, that doesn't seem like it's been broken. That seems like you've given this money to an agency or to this. This group. It doesn't. You haven't disproven that this group is attached to. Soros says first off, CS2 was awarded the GR in 2016. FJP. The Soros. Org was founded a year later in 2017. Still doesn't mean they don't work together now. And it doesn't mean that he wasn't a part of the people that were. I mean, like it's. I'm not saying he is, and I'm not saying he was, but I'm saying this is not disproving anything.

[01:05:58]
As far as I can tell by googling, there has never been any organizational affiliation between the two organizations. Okay, by googling, that's it. You just googled. I want you to google vaccine injuries and tell me if there's any good luck. Good luck. COVID 19 vaccine injuries tell me. You can decide everything that you need to know about COVID 19 vaccine injuries by a Google search. You're not going to, right? Okay, so by googling, there's never been any organizational affiliation between the two organizations. CS2's work appears to be funding civil society organizations, CSOs abroad. What does that mean? As far as I can tell, that's a little vague. It mainly means they give money out to nonprofits in foreign countries to do things like monitor and fight disease spread, monitor human rights abuses. This sounds a little like whitewashing, promoting digital security and so on. They do only good things, John. They definitely don't get involved in shady characters that are trying to rewrite the way our legal system deals with violent criminals.

[01:07:06]
Nah, I've never understood Soros.

[01:07:10]
I don't get it either. Elon Musk hates him. You know, I have a limited amount of knowledge, but I do know that he spends a lot of money on these like super progressive liberal DA's. I don't know whether or not Mike Benz, who's gonna be here soon, can really trace that 27 million. I'll ask him. But the end of the line, it's like this is all vague. Like, what is that? What's that 24 million going to? Like what, what it might be. Going to fight diseases. It might be. Or sure. Or you don't know. How about you don't know? And all was Google whether or not those people know each other. That's crazy. Doesn't mean they do it. Doesn't mean it's corrupt. It doesn't mean it goes to Soros funds. But you didn't disprove it.

[01:07:49]
Well, that's anymore. You can't hardly tell what's true. I mean, the rumors that are floating around are. Is it AI? Is it true? Is it. What am I looking at?

[01:07:59]
Yeah, a lot of AI stuff.

[01:08:01]
And the rumors I've. We're talking about rumors on the drive and I'm going, Sometimes you just can't do anything about them. You just got to let them run. And then if you can improve them, if you're involved in it, improve it somehow to make it a better rumor. One of the most recent rumors, and I was looking, talking to Drew this morning, the. The rumor that Elon Musk was going to put four commercials on the super bowl about Doge and all the things. They're fine. Things are doing. Yeah, he didn't do that.

[01:08:34]
I wonder if that's even legal.

[01:08:36]
That was fake news.

[01:08:37]
Right. But that seems like if you can make a stylish video about. I wonder if that's legal. Right? Like, I don't know what the rules are. I don't even know if it should be legal. Like, what are the rules in terms of if you're. If you're involved in some sort of a government agency or a government discovery agency, which is like, what Doge is. Right. If you're involved in that, like, would you be able to propagandize to the people, even in a positive way, even if it's true, like, make a video showing how amazing a job you're doing and do it in a cinematic way that makes it Compelling. That seems like a lot of influence, right?

[01:09:16]
Yeah. Supposedly he was going to spend 40 million on it or something like that.

[01:09:20]
Yeah, but that's just the Internet.

[01:09:21]
I know. It's crazy.

[01:09:22]
I didn't even ask him. And then I went online looking for them.

[01:09:27]
Well, I was thinking every. At least there's going to be one a quarter. Didn't see one in the first quarter and the second quarter, the half. And by then, the game was kind of over.

[01:09:38]
Well, that's like when Everybody thought that JFK Jr. Was going to come back to life and show up in Dallas.

[01:09:43]
And. Yeah.

[01:09:46]
There'S a lot of those online that you have to wonder what those are, because I used to think, oh, there's just some idiot made this up. But now I'm more inclined to think that some of that is just more disinformation that's designed to muddy the waters of truth. And the more of that, the better. The more it makes it easy to, like, move stuff around and you forget about other things. Like, what's Benghazi? I got this to worry about. And there's, like, always some new thing that's popping up everywhere, and it's, like, keep you distracted completely. Trump's gonna have four commercials about how Elon Musk. No, nothing. Not one commercial. I did think it was interesting that Taylor Swift got booed.

[01:10:28]
We talked about that. There's.

[01:10:30]
That was crazy.

[01:10:31]
Max. And Max and Drew out there was Saying it's because 75% of the people were Phillies fans in that stadium. I don't know. Could be fake news.

[01:10:40]
The dude tweeted, I hate Taylor Swift.

[01:10:47]
Jesus Christ.

[01:10:48]
So ridiculous. Imagine, like, you being the people that are around him, and you see that tweet like, oh, freak, take his phone away. Satire. The claim about Elon spending $40 million on ads for the super bowl originated from the Tick Tock account. Brian Banjo. Brian Banjo is a satire account. Okay. So people just ran with it. There you go.

[01:11:13]
The wrong date on it, apparently.

[01:11:15]
That makes sense. That makes sense.

[01:11:17]
I saw a clip this morning with George Lucas was saying that he filmed the moon landing.

[01:11:21]
Oh, you mean Stanley Kubrick.

[01:11:24]
I'm sorry.

[01:11:25]
Yeah. That is an actor that's doing that. And that's why it's like, a really close cropped footage of him. You don't, like, zoom in. He doesn't quite look like Kubrick, but he looks like a weird old guy with a beard. And so if you don't know what Kubrick looks like.

[01:11:40]
Yeah, it's.

[01:11:41]
Yeah, not Kubrick. But if anybody Faked the moon landing. It was that guy.

[01:11:47]
What about Buzz Aldrin? Have you. He. I think he came out and said, no, I was. I would know. We didn't land there.

[01:11:54]
Well, he said some weird stuff. But the weird stuff you could attribute to, like, Biden type weird stuff. Like when you get old, sometimes the, the old dome don't work so good. And yeah, your words come out goofy, like he was talking to that young girl. Because it didn't happen. We never went like he said something weird like that. But I think as a conspiracy theorist, I want to believe that that's him letting everybody know. That's not nearly as interesting as the Neil Armstrong one. The Neil Armstrong one is crazy. And this is at the 25th anniversary of the moon landing. He gives a speech in front of America's best and brightest high school students. And instead of saying, I went to the moon, it was amazing. He gives the most cryptic explanation for what they have to do in order to progress in science. Play it for me, Jamie, because when you see it, when you listen to it, like, what the freak is he saying? And why would you ever say that when you're giving a speech to the best high school students in the country at the White House, why would you say this?

[01:13:05]
Like, play. On the anniversary of the event in 1994, Neil Armstrong made a rare public appearance and held back tears as he spoke these brief, cryptic remarks before the next generation of taxpayers as they toured the White House. Today we have with us a group of students among America's best. Best to you, we say, we have only completed a beginning. We leave you much that is undone. There are great ideas, undiscovered breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truth's protective layers. What the freak does that mean? Breakthroughs for those who can remove one of truth's protective layers. Truth's protective layers? What the freak does that mean? Like, why would you say that? That is so cryptic. I don't care what reasonable explanations you have, that is undeniably cryptic. And if you're a person that did something in 1969 that no one's come even close to recreat creating today. It's a little weird.

[01:14:26]
Yeah, it's a little weird.

[01:14:28]
And that's just part of what's a little weird about it. It's a little weird that it's got almost a religious connotation to it where people want to believe in it, like they believe in the resurrection. They want to believe in it despite any evidence. I believe in the resurrection more how about that?

[01:14:46]
Take that rumor and twist it around however you want. Make it. Make it something you can do.

[01:14:51]
The moon landing one. I'm like, I don't know, I don't think so. I don't know. But if I had a guess, I don't think so. And then what's really weird is we had that Bart Sobrill guy on. That was his documentary Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon. He was showing us some footage where the Russians had used AI to do an analysis on some of the photos from the moon. And they said that they were deceptive. So they use AI on all these other images. It can shows like, like a high 90% accuracy whether or not something's been with. And they're like, these are all. These have been monkeyed with. It's all edited.

[01:15:32]
You don't know what to believe. I mean, I just saw a clip yesterday with my voice again, talking about.

[01:15:38]
I sent you something. I sent you one of them.

[01:15:41]
Oh, yeah. No, it has you and me and talking like this, and we're talking about some space enterprise with stars, ships and shoot. And I'm going, how do they do this?

[01:15:51]
They can do a whole podcast with your voice. Now, not only could they do a whole podcast with your voice, AI could generate the content. Like you'd say, I want to talk to John Reeves about biological evolution and what the current state of science is and what the future holds for us.

[01:16:07]
And that'll be used in the clip that we're going to see within a week. Probably your voice.

[01:16:12]
Probably because they could make a one hour podcast with you just relaying the current state of the art and science. It's really wild and it's probably going to get worse. Like, it's going to be. It's going to be so good that I'm going to think it's you or I'm going to think it's me. I'm like, maybe I forgot about that one.

[01:16:29]
You know, as I get older, you know, I forget shoot. And I think it's true.

[01:16:34]
I think that's a defense mechanism.

[01:16:36]
I don't want to remember that one. I'll forget about that one. But, you know, we. We both made it around one more time. Around the sun.

[01:16:48]
Yeah.

[01:16:49]
And it's been an unbelievable year. You know, the. What we've both seen in the last.

[01:16:56]
Year, it's definitely been a. It's a wild time to be alive, right?

[01:17:00]
Yep.

[01:17:01]
Yeah. Filled with turmoil.

[01:17:04]
I think it's also because it's so quick, the information that you can Get. It's coming at you from every direction.

[01:17:11]
Yeah.

[01:17:12]
Instantly.

[01:17:13]
Instantly.

[01:17:13]
But in 1920, that wasn't happening.

[01:17:16]
No.

[01:17:17]
Wasn't happening in 1880.

[01:17:18]
No.

[01:17:19]
It was like. You didn't know. Like, when Seward bought Alaska, you didn't know why he did that. Everybody said, seward's Folly. How about Seward's genius?

[01:17:31]
They thought it was a bad deal.

[01:17:34]
Yeah. $7 million for Alaska.

[01:17:37]
That's so funny.

[01:17:38]
Two cents an acre. Now, let me tell you something. A guy named Klaus Nasky, who's a doctor of history at University of Alaska, I used to teach his kid how to swim. Him and I were at a social function someplace, and we were talking, and we're talking about the purchase of Alaska. And he goes, you know why we did that, right? I said, well, yeah, Seward wanted to buy it and.7 million bucks. He goes, yeah, we gave $7 million to Russia. I said, okay, that's. Yeah, they sold it to us. He goes, why do you think they did that? I said, I don't know. They said it was because the seals were gone. You know, they had gotten all the seals trade done. He goes, that's not why. During the Civil War, Russia blockaded Charleston harbor with their warships, and it helped the north win the Civil War. And the bill for that was $7 million. And they knew they couldn't just go out to America and say, yeah, the Russians helped us win the Civil War.

[01:18:39]
Really?

[01:18:40]
This is what he told me, Doctor of History. And I said the same thing. He goes, yeah. He goes, nobody talks about it. Nobody even mentions it. But Russia took the 7 million and they gave us Alaska. That'll justify this $7 million.

[01:19:01]
Wow. What do you think about the idea that the United States taking over Canada?

[01:19:07]
Well, it makes Alaska the third largest freaking state. First we got to get Greenland. Let's get Greenland. So we got them surrounded, kind of.

[01:19:15]
I thought he was just joking around about Canada, but he seems serious.

[01:19:19]
Well, I think Drew. And Drew was talking about this the other day. Canada's got seven. I'm not sure how many provinces, but they're different. And so what they might want to do is make seven new states. Because the people in Alberta do different stuff.

[01:19:36]
Yeah.

[01:19:36]
Than the people.

[01:19:37]
You can't just have the state of Canada.

[01:19:40]
No. Because it'd be like LA and New York Colony elections.

[01:19:44]
No, it'd be way worse because Montreal and Quebec is French. Mean, it's basically French speaking. Everyone speaks French. It's. It's so different than the rest of the country. There's a lot of French speaking people in Canada in general. But it. There's way more on the East Coast. The Vancouver and Montreal, very different places. Like, you gotta. They have to be different cities, man. You can't. Different states. You can't have them be just one part of a big country. If there's seven different provinces. Yeah. So we have seven new states now. Fine. Why not? What? We can't count past 51. What is that? It's ridiculous.

[01:20:20]
People forget what it's like to expand America. The last time we did it was Alaska.

[01:20:27]
People just get scared of it. They get scared of the idea of the empire, the American empire expanding. It makes you think about Hitler. It makes you think about fascism and dangerous military decisions that get made. Take over countries and wars that happen. That's what people get scared of. But if Canada just wants to join, that'd be pretty cool.

[01:20:47]
Yeah. They got a lot of natural resources.

[01:20:50]
Yeah. Also, their government's goofy as shoot. You guys don't even have freedom of speech. You should be protected by the Constitution.

[01:20:58]
Yeah. Then they get the second amendment.

[01:21:00]
Yeah. And the. Well, they used to have gun laws over there that were pretty favorable. But then when Trudeau came around, like, you can't even. You can't even give someone a handgun. I don't think anymore.

[01:21:10]
It's gotten. Well, I know a few Canadians, they don't like. They don't like Trudeau. They don't like what he's done to the country.

[01:21:18]
Well, there's got to be somebody that likes him. He keeps winning.

[01:21:21]
He's got.

[01:21:21]
He's got just the numbers. So kind. They're so nice that they're, like, willing to give a dork like that a second and a third chance.

[01:21:33]
Well, the farmers don't like them. I don't think the miners don't like them.

[01:21:39]
Well, certainly the truck drivers that are involved in that trucker convoy, that was crazy. And not just the trucker convoy, but the people that donated to the trucker convoy got their bank accounts shut down, which is just crazy. That's just crazy. Like you. You got to have laws against that. That's tyranny. You can't allow people to shut down someone's entire bank account. They can't feed themselves because they donated to a person who's politically opposed to what you're doing.

[01:22:04]
Yeah, yeah. Anyways, Alaska, I think, coming from the guy that told me that he's dead now, but I believe it. But back then, there was no fact checkers. There was no way to tell people what was going on. So let's just tell them we. We. We bought it.

[01:22:21]
That's interesting. Russia helped the United States win the Civil War. See? Have you ever found anything on that, Jamie? I've never heard that before. I wouldn't be surprised, though. Well, sure, back then they could hide all kinds of shoot too.

[01:22:33]
The north didn't have the navy.

[01:22:35]
How much do you think Greenland's worth?

[01:22:38]
I was talking to my accountant this morning. I think Greenland, if it became a state, it would be the largest state in the country.

[01:22:49]
Oh, yeah, it's a big spot.

[01:22:50]
And then Alaska would be second. But Texas is always going to be screwed. No matter how many more states we get, Texas is always going to go down the list. Yep, it's still huge. Greenland, then Canada, Alaska. America. I kind of like Mexico too. Might as well take the whole. All of it.

[01:23:11]
I don't think the Mexico is a big deal with that. The Mexicans would probably be very upset if we try to take over Mexico. But it would be nice if Mexico had the same opportunities as America and that it wasn't so. So attractive to try to swim across the river to get here.

[01:23:25]
Well, what I don't get, Joe, we got a pretty good navy, we got a pretty good Air Force, we got a pretty good military base. What the freak are we doing not sending A10s down there into Mexico and taking those fentanyl labs out? What are you gonna do? Mexico? You don't like us doing that? We just said they're terrorists. We're gonna blow up their freaking buildings. We'll tell them we're coming, but we're gonna blow the freak out of that stuff. They're gonna have no infrastructure left. What are you gonna do? No more avocados? Give me a freaking break. Send some A10s. I. I've had A10s on my ground buzzing my ground for years. They practice on my ground. Well, they're awesome. Those pilots are good.

[01:24:08]
Yeah.

[01:24:09]
A couple little warthogs in there and a take care of business.

[01:24:12]
What do you think? That looks like a war with the cartels.

[01:24:14]
I've stumbled across this, but that doesn't exactly say the same.

[01:24:18]
It says, while all this is transpiring, one of the most unusual events, diplomatic in naval history occurred. Russia dispatched her Atlantic and Pacific naval squadrons to the United States ports. They arrived in New York and San Francisco, respectively, in September 1863, at a time when the tide of war had turned in the favor of the North. At Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the fleets remained the United States waters for about seven Months before being ordered to return to their homeland.

[01:24:44]
Oh, they had a. They didn't. They must have had wooden ships then because I just found their first ironclad ship was built in Britain in 1861.

[01:24:52]
Whoa.

[01:24:53]
It said it stayed in Russian waters the entire time.

[01:24:56]
Whoa.

[01:24:56]
They had their own civil war.

[01:24:57]
Just after all they were going to war with wood ships. Gangster.

[01:25:03]
They knocked the out of the seal population.

[01:25:07]
Oh, I'm sure.

[01:25:08]
Oh yeah. They're really good at what they did.

[01:25:10]
They used to be like seals everywhere.

[01:25:12]
Oh yeah, yeah.

[01:25:13]
And are they endangered now? Like what's the.

[01:25:16]
I don't really know because I don't. We don't have any in our area. But I have a friend that's a mechanic who's telling me he had a lady come into his auto shop and said something was wrong with her engine. And so he went out and told her, he said, it looks like you blew a seal. She said, no, I had tuna fish for lunch. Yeah. You don't tell a comic a joke, do you? Yeah, yeah. Yes. I've been saving that one.

[01:25:47]
I know that native Alaskans are allowed to hunt seals and they eat them.

[01:25:53]
Yeah.

[01:25:53]
But regular people can't.

[01:25:56]
I think they share.

[01:25:57]
There's weird rules on that though. Yeah, you might be able to share.

[01:26:00]
But you subsistence harvesting.

[01:26:02]
Yeah. You ever watch that show Life below Zero?

[01:26:05]
I have seen that.

[01:26:06]
Yeah. Part of that show was like this one guy was living with this native Alaskan wife and their kids and they would go hunt the seals and she would like shoot the seals and she had to pull the trigger. Then he could help like butcher them up.

[01:26:20]
There's about 141,000 in non glacial areas. Now the Wikipedia says that there were 300,000 once population in the 1850s.

[01:26:34]
Oh no, that's sea otters.

[01:26:35]
Oh.

[01:26:35]
So yeah, I guess I read that wrong.

[01:26:37]
It says once a population of $300,000. 300,000 sea otters are. Was almost extinct. Russia needed money after being defeated by France and Britain in the Crimean War. The California gold rush show that if gold were discovered in Alaska, Americans Canadians could overwhelm the Russian presence in what one scholar later described as Siberia's Siberia. However, the principal reason for the sale was that the hard to defend colony would be easily conquered by British forces based in neigh Canada in any future conflict. And Russia did not wish to see its arch rival being next door just across the Bering Sea. Therefore, Emperor Alexander II decided to sell the territory. The Russian government discussed the proposal in 1857 and 1858 and offered to sell the territory to the United States. So, as before, all that in the Civil War, hoping that its presence in the region would offset the plans of Britain. However, no deal was reached as the risk of an American civil war was more pressing concern in Washington.

[01:27:36]
Plausible space for our new news today.

[01:27:39]
In this story, our new news, what.

[01:27:41]
He said about the Russian ships, that kind of fits. It could happen.

[01:27:44]
Yes. Because it says 1857. 1858. They agreed to sell it and offered to sell. So they agreed, but then they had to put it on the back burner because of the war. So then after the war, they bought it.

[01:27:57]
It.

[01:27:57]
So it might have been that they said, look, we'll still buy it, but we help us out.

[01:28:00]
This is how we got it covered.

[01:28:01]
Yeah, that makes sense.

[01:28:03]
Yeah. Well, this guy's like Dr. Emeritus in history. I mean, he knows his. Or he did.

[01:28:08]
The problem is, then you have to trust those guys. I'd rather trust Wikipedia.

[01:28:12]
Yeah. Anything I read on Wikipedia's got to be true.

[01:28:16]
Way.

[01:28:16]
Let's see, there's now 70,000.

[01:28:18]
Oh, there's only 70,000 left.

[01:28:19]
Yeah.

[01:28:20]
That's sea otters, though. Sea otters are vicious little freakers.

[01:28:28]
Slingsby up there, and he sees a lot of that kind of stuff. Otters, all the sea life up there.

[01:28:35]
Oh, yeah.

[01:28:36]
You follow him?

[01:28:37]
Yeah. There's a giant difference between, like, the coastal Alaska and regular Alaska. Coastal Alaska is wild.

[01:28:44]
He went out, just slayed the king crab last year.

[01:28:47]
Oh, I'm sure.

[01:28:47]
Yeah.

[01:28:48]
But that is not worth dying for. That show, the Most Deadly Harvest or Deadliest Harvest, whatever show. I watched that show. I go, guys, get out of there.

[01:28:57]
I haven't seen that show.

[01:28:59]
You never seen that show? You know the show, Jamie, Right? The.

[01:29:01]
It's.

[01:29:02]
What is it called? Deadliest Harvest. The. The crab fishing show.

[01:29:06]
And that was called Deadliest Catch.

[01:29:07]
Deadliest Catch. That's right. Deadliest Catch. That's right.

[01:29:10]
Yeah. They're way out in the middle of the freaking ocean there.

[01:29:13]
Yeah. And they're freaking rocking back and forth. Guys fall overboard sometimes. F. That.

[01:29:20]
Yeah. No, that's. That's crazy.

[01:29:21]
Fall for crab. And I get it. I want crab, too, but not that bad. Guys.

[01:29:29]
You get it from Slingsby. Big crabs, you know, he goes out, drills through the ice and brings them.

[01:29:35]
Up through the ice.

[01:29:36]
Oh, yeah. He gets them in the wintertime.

[01:29:38]
Really?

[01:29:38]
Yeah.

[01:29:39]
So it's ocean ice.

[01:29:41]
It's right offshore, right there in nomency.

[01:29:43]
So you can walk on the ocean ice?

[01:29:45]
Oh, yeah.

[01:29:45]
Out there.

[01:29:46]
Yeah. Yeah.

[01:29:46]
How thick is the Ocean ice.

[01:29:47]
Thick, thicker than freak.

[01:29:51]
I didn't even know we had that. I mean, I got. Obviously because of glaciers, but I didn't even think that there was, like, places where you could walk over frozen ocean and drill through it.

[01:30:01]
They have a. They have a gold mining show that they. They film off the coast of Nome where they cut through the ice and they send divers down with suction dredges.

[01:30:09]
Whoa.

[01:30:10]
It's on Discovery Channel to look for gold. Yeah.

[01:30:13]
Cut through the ice, dive through a freaking hole in the ocean ice.

[01:30:17]
Forget the name of that show.

[01:30:18]
What is that? Cold plunge. Like, how long can they stay down there?

[01:30:23]
Some of them stay down there all day. Eight hours. They'll do a whole shift.

[01:30:28]
How can you do that?

[01:30:29]
They have suits on that keep. And they have warm water pumped into your wetsuit or your dry suit.

[01:30:35]
How deep are they down there?

[01:30:37]
Here you go.

[01:30:38]
Is this the show? Yeah.

[01:30:42]
I've met her before. She's a nice lady. She's an opera singer.

[01:30:48]
This is crazy. This. The way that people live so differently in the world. There's people that. This is their reality. They get a little ice fishing hut they set them up.

[01:30:59]
Oh, what they're doing is just unbelievable.

[01:31:02]
So what's he doing now? He's cutting holes in the.

[01:31:04]
Getting ready to go down. Yeah, that's from Palm Recky.

[01:31:07]
And this guy's got this suit that's. And so how deep is he going?

[01:31:11]
They go down about 30ft.

[01:31:14]
Oh, Jesus Christ.

[01:31:15]
There you go.

[01:31:17]
freak this, dude. freak this. This. This creeps me out just watching it. And so they go all the way to the bottom to get gold. They must have a lot of gold down there.

[01:31:29]
There's a lot of gold. Gold on there.

[01:31:31]
Like, how much is this worth? 29 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperature of the water.

[01:31:38]
I mean, he has to get. He has to get through the overburden.

[01:31:43]
But it's worth it.

[01:31:45]
Yeah. I mean, he does quite well.

[01:31:47]
What's quite well? Like, what do you think these guys pull a year?

[01:31:51]
Well, they probably make more off Discovery Channel than they do gold mining.

[01:31:55]
Really?

[01:31:55]
Yeah. I think I know a few of these guys. They don't get much gold, but they're.

[01:32:03]
Willing to do that.

[01:32:03]
Oh, yeah.

[01:32:04]
For not much gold.

[01:32:05]
Yeah. But they get a pretty good paycheck. You got to remember something. You know this. There's nothing real about reality tv.

[01:32:13]
That's true.

[01:32:14]
Nothing.

[01:32:15]
That's true.

[01:32:15]
We did it. We did a stint with the Discovery Channel. I'm sorry, National Geographic no more.

[01:32:23]
It's a disaster.

[01:32:24]
Well, yeah, I mean, they. They want. They want to make drama. They want to pit the kids against each other.

[01:32:29]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[01:32:30]
We don't. No, no, no, no, no, no. We don't do that.

[01:32:33]
Isn't that hilarious? Like, they. That's all those shows. All those shows are like that. They're all like someone squabbling. It's all housewives and, yeah, you gotta hate on her and hate on him.

[01:32:44]
Those are good.

[01:32:45]
Oh, these little breakers. Yeah, these are good. You want one?

[01:32:48]
No, thanks.

[01:32:48]
So you. You're off nicotine entirely?

[01:32:51]
Well, I do this in. Once in a while.

[01:32:53]
Once in a while.

[01:32:54]
My doctor said that these are Tucker Carlson's.

[01:32:57]
Makes his own Alps.

[01:32:58]
Oh, does he?

[01:32:59]
Yeah, I'll give you one.

[01:33:00]
Oh, cool. No, I. I was talking to the doctor, you know, he says you might go through some nicotine withdrawals. And I said, no, I won't. I quit. I'm done. He says it's not the. It's not the nicotine that's hurting you. It's the smoking that's hurting you. The carcinogenics going in your lungs and all the chemicals and all that bullshoot. He says nicotine is as good as caffeine. It's just straight up nicotine's fine.

[01:33:25]
Yeah, I believe that.

[01:33:26]
And I'm going, okay. I like that. I've tried it.

[01:33:29]
It's also. It's a legitimate cognitive enhancer. It's a legitimate. What they call a nootropic. It really does affect you cognitively. The thing is, like, you're. The best way to get it is a cigarette. And like, doing it that way is killing you. It kills everybody. Just takes. It. Robs you. Gives you something, and it robs you. Gives you something, takes a little way, and you don't notice. You don't notice.

[01:33:51]
In my case, I got to the point in my life where I'm going. I've done it for so long, something's going to get me.

[01:33:57]
Yeah.

[01:33:58]
But now I realize, hey, it won't be. It won't be that. It won't be smoking. It might be a bear coming, you know, coming up on me without me seeing it. Might drive a cat over the edge. I don't know what'll happen, but I honestly never thought I'd get past 50. When I was growing up, I thought I'd be dead by 45.

[01:34:19]
Why?

[01:34:22]
Child of the 70s, man. It's all up that. You know that the. There's a former governor of Alaska named Walter Hickel that Richard Nixon appointed to be secretary of the Interior in 1970. So he went and did that and went into Nixon one day and says, look, the Vietnam War is wrong. Nixon goes, you're fired, and get out of here. So he went back to Alaska, became a governor. Great governor. Probably one of the best governors we ever had. And at some point, he was a Republican, but the Republicans already had a candidate, the Democrats had a candidate. So he ran as an Alaskan for Independence candidate. Their party platform was to secede from the United States. And I used to be the treasurer for that group. I'm going, I like this guy. That sounds like fun. Let's do that. That guy got elected.

[01:35:21]
Wow.

[01:35:22]
And Jack Coghill was his lieutenant governor. I knew him quite well.

[01:35:26]
So he wanted to become a country.

[01:35:28]
I still do. If I'm telling you, Mike, you want.

[01:35:33]
The United States to take over Canada, but you want Alaska to be its own country.

[01:35:37]
This was all when Biden was there. I'm thinking, worst case scenario, we're going to get the girl that didn't want to be on your show. If we get her, I want Alaska to become its own country. We just got to get away from this. It's a train wreck. But since Trump got in and he's doing the things that he said he was going to do. Hey, I like the idea. You want to expand America. Expand America. It's a good idea. It's been done before.

[01:36:01]
So you're willing to keep Alaska as a part of America?

[01:36:03]
Yeah.

[01:36:04]
Why don't you run for governor?

[01:36:05]
Ah, freak that.

[01:36:06]
You'd be a fun governor.

[01:36:07]
I would be a fun governor.

[01:36:12]
The way you said it. Give it a go. No, no, no, no, no, no. Why don't you.

[01:36:17]
Why don't you run for governor?

[01:36:18]
I don't have time.

[01:36:20]
I'm busy. I know you're busy, but I. I don't know. No, I can't do it.

[01:36:28]
You don't need that in your life. I'm just kidding. I'm completely kidding.

[01:36:31]
People come up and go, give me some. Something. This is an issue. And I'm thinking, why is it an issue? I don't give a about that. That's not a good politician.

[01:36:44]
Right.

[01:36:46]
A politician I know that I talked to one day as a state senator, he goes, here's a trick. All you do when they say that, you go, I see. That's it.

[01:36:58]
That's it.

[01:36:59]
Just say, I see.

[01:37:01]
You listen to them. I see. And you don't really care.

[01:37:04]
No. You don't give a freak.

[01:37:06]
Well, a lot of them definitely don't. A lot of them are just using as like an audition to become president. You know, they just want to do good enough job to get the big job.

[01:37:17]
Well, President Trump just announced recently that he wants to get a gas line built through Alaska. And talking about governors, Governor Palin appointed me to be the gas line project coordinator for DOT back when she was governor. And there's another guy that worked for DOT named Frank Richards. And so I went to work to get a gas line permit written and worked with a guy named Harry Noah, who was a commissioner under DNR's. I'm sorry, under Governor Hickel. He was a commissioner of DNR. So him and I worked on this permit to get a pipeline built through Alaska. Took us three years. I'm the guy that wrote it. I'm the guy that signed it along with Harry. So when President Trump was on his doing an interview three days after he got elected, he goes, and we have a fully permitted pipeline in Alaska to go ahead and build a gas line through Alaska. I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop the tv. Back it up a little bit. I wrote the freaking permit. I signed the freaking permit. He's talking about some work that I did. That's all right. So Frank Richards now is the president of the Alaska Gas Line Developer Project.

[01:38:29]
And they just inked a deal with Japan, who came in and said, yeah, we want to buy into this. It's a $44 billion project.

[01:38:37]
So what's the hurdle for pipelines and for oil drilling in the past? Is it environmental that people worried it's going to ruin the environment?

[01:38:48]
There's a thing called anwr, the Arctic National Wildlife Range. I think it's. Yeah, something like that. And when the president renamed well, Anwar, you're not allowed to drill in anwr. You can't drill for oil and animal. There's a lot of oil there. But the feds said, you can't drill for oil there. You can't produce oil out of there. But that was for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But if you change it to the America National Wildlife Refuge, kind of like the Gulf of America, you might be able to drill in there.

[01:39:19]
Is that really all it takes? You just got to rename it, apparently.

[01:39:22]
The Gulf America Works.

[01:39:24]
So they're going to Redrill. They're going to start drilling in the Gulf of America now. It is, by the way, very hilarious.

[01:39:30]
I bet they said it at the.

[01:39:32]
Inauguration was like this motherfreaker. Like, this is such a crazy thing to say.

[01:39:37]
And he did it. He signed it yesterday on the way across the Gulf of America?

[01:39:41]
Yeah.

[01:39:44]
I was in where we stay on the way over in Louisiana, having dinner. I asked the waitress, I said, how far away are we from the Gulf of America? Boy, oh, no.

[01:40:03]
Well, we're very divided as a country. My hope is that what he does winds up being undeniably good. This is the best case scenario. That's what I hope for every president. What happens is undeniably good. Everybody benefits. And we all realize, like, hey, this is. We're going to be okay, but we should be united as a country. We shouldn't be united only with the people of our political party. That's stupid. We're supposed to be one team. And, you know, this is the new coach or this is the new president. Let's, okay, like, get on board. This is. This is what's happening now. And if there's something that you think is egregiously wrong, like all this USA stuff, like, hey, maybe there's some really good programs in there that we should all examine and we should reinstate, but they should examine it. The idea that you shouldn't examine it, that there's no argument for that. Once you found $200 million that goes to transgender animal tests, you know, you got some freakery like, you can't spend $200 million on transgender animal tests while you're $36 trillion in debt and not spending any money on East Palestine.

[01:41:07]
Yeah, like, what happened to that place, huh? What about the toxic spill in East Palestine? What about the health effects of those people that deal with that, that burning toxic in their air for weeks and weeks? What happened to them? Anybody check. Anybody go into that ground and see what the. The groundwater's like? Anybody dig that stuff out and process it? Are they doing anything about that?

[01:41:29]
Not yet. They go in, you can see videos where they stick. Sticks in the water and machine comes right out, bro.

[01:41:35]
How about Flint, Michigan? How about that? How about their water? Still up?

[01:41:39]
Yep.

[01:41:40]
I get a glbutt of water. Remember Obama did that. This is not a stone. I want a glbutt of water. And he sips it like this, like a little lizard. He barely drank it. It's so crazy to ask for a glbutt of water where, you know the water is polluted and you don't even drink it. That's so crazy. That's so crazy. You didn't even take a gulp. You ever see that? He sips it like this, like this. Like, barely. Have you seen it?

[01:42:08]
No.

[01:42:08]
You should watch it. Should watch it because it's fun. It's fun to Watch. Because it's so crazy. It's almost like they were trying to talk him into it, and he was like, I'm not drinking that water. And, like, listen, just drink a little bit of it. Just. It'd be good for everybody. Just go out there and say, can I. Glad. A glbutt of water it is.

[01:42:25]
There you go.

[01:42:26]
You know, generally, I have not been.

[01:42:28]
Doing stunts here, but, you know.

[01:42:32]
And what was that?

[01:42:34]
Used a filter. The water around this table was flint water that was filtered. And it just confirms what we know scientifically, which is that if you're using a filter, if you're installing it, then flint water at this point is drinkable.

[01:42:55]
Stop. Pause. If I was in an audience, I'd be yelling, chug, chug. Chug. Chug, chug. Get him gallons of that and then monitor his diarrhea. Okay, let's. What are you talking. You didn't even drink that. Make your pasta in that, sir. Go make your rice in that water using a filter. These people are so poor. They, like. That's a very impoverished community. I bet a lot of those people don't have filters. So you're saying if they don't have filters, they're freaked? Is that what you're saying? And you only drank it like this? You barely drank it. It didn't move. The level of water didn't change. You just dipped your tongue in there. You didn't really drink. That's so crazy to not drink it.

[01:43:34]
Well, we did eight years with that guy, right?

[01:43:36]
Yeah.

[01:43:38]
We got out of a long relationship.

[01:43:40]
Well, kind of with all of them. You know, it's just the job of being a president is so hard. I used to say I want Hillary to win because I want a woman to be president. So I realized they can't freaking do that job either. Nobody does that job. Right?

[01:43:53]
Right.

[01:43:53]
Everybody freaks it up. Nobody ever gets it right. It's always just a disaster. Everybody. Half the country, at least, hates you. The other giant percentages of the population, even on your team, are disappointed in you because you didn't do exactly what they want you to do.

[01:44:07]
We've got a. We've got a pretty good group of legislators in Alaska.

[01:44:11]
Yeah.

[01:44:12]
Yeah. For the most part. They're all. You know, they're gonna have their squabbles and stuff, but pretty much everybody on the same page.

[01:44:19]
I think you guys are different humans. Alaska's just more durable, reliable people because you have to deal with the cold and you got bears and moose and shoot running around up there. I think it makes different People. When you live in the same neighborhood as grizzly bears, it just makes everything a little different.

[01:44:36]
Yeah, it actually does. And the people are generally nice to each other.

[01:44:42]
Mm.

[01:44:42]
And considerate.

[01:44:44]
Well, but they seem, like I said, more robust. When I was in Anchorage, we. We. Me and my friend Ari went up there, did some shows, did a little fishing. We're like, these people are like better people. They're like, more solid. Like, everybody. Even just like the regular people hanging out at the bar, they, like, had their together more. And they were both like. I guess they kind of have to, because otherwise you freeze to death. You can't just be a off up here. It's too goddamn cold. And you can't just go wander in the woods. You'll get eaten. Your freaking. Your food, Jack. You can't go too far. Stay close. Stay with your people. Support each other. Someone has a flat tire, freaking help him, all right? Because you would want to get help, too. You could die out there. That's the difference.

[01:45:30]
I used to always think that if I go bear hunting, I'm going to go with somebody who I can outrun. But now I get a lot of people asking me if I want to go bear hunting. No.

[01:45:42]
Yeah. You could be in the wrong spot. It doesn't matter who's running fast. That bear is going to get somebody or all of you, depending upon what's going on. But that's a dangerous kind of hunting. You're hunting something that's like, the apex predator of North America and you don't even eat it. I have a bunch of friends who go grizzly hunting, and the way they put it, like, first of all, you have to control the populations. Like, if you don't, you get a situation that's happening, like in Montana where they want to list them, but they've been delisted for so long with. The only place you can hunt grizzly bears in America is Alaska. And a lot of people that live in Montana don't think that's good. They think they should put them back on the list because they're just. There's way too many human interactions.

[01:46:25]
I have a grizzly bear hide I got from Slingsby up in Nome, and It's on that 1885 pool table that I told you.

[01:46:34]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:35]
That you're gonna. I'm not gonna play on that pool table till you show up.

[01:46:38]
Oh, Jesus.

[01:46:39]
It covers that pool table. I'm sure got two of those now.

[01:46:43]
They're big animals, man, especially the coastal ones. Have you ever seen one? One of the coastal ones up close.

[01:46:50]
Not grizzly bears. I've seen polar bears and stuff like that.

[01:46:54]
You seen polar bears up there?

[01:46:55]
Well, not in Fairbanks. I've seen north of Nome. Yeah, yeah, they have them up there. I mean, they. They had one polar bear, apparently, I don't know if it's true or not, that walked into the interior of Alaska. I mean, it just went traveling. Really gonna have me a little cross country jaunt.

[01:47:13]
freak. Running into that thing.

[01:47:14]
Well, they're. They eat nothing but meat. Yeah, they're badbutt.

[01:47:19]
They're the most badbutt of all of them. Them, they are just 100% predator. As sketchiest bear to be around. There's this video I was watching of these guys the other day that were in a truck, and they were filming this polar bear as it just kept getting closer and closer. And then they started panicking. Okay. It's like 30 yards away. Like that sprinting distance. We got to get in the truck. And they get in the truck, and the polar bear just climbed on top of the truck. It was like. And he was like, we got to start the truck and get the freak out of here. Like, this thing's going to break the glbutt.

[01:47:51]
They're bad.

[01:47:52]
Yeah.

[01:47:53]
You don't. You don't want to freak with them.

[01:47:55]
That's just a can of meat to them. They don't give a freak about you. You're just food. They live in a frozen wasteland. Anything that's moving around is edible.

[01:48:03]
Yeah. Last time.

[01:48:05]
Yeah. Look at these guys. Bro, don't do that. Do not do that. Please don't do that. That's so dangerous. That's not your friend. That thing just wants to eat you. Isn't it so weird? It's so not worried about people because it's not threatened by anything because it's such a top dog that it just, like, will just wander right up to your building. Hey, what's inside? I smell meat. I want to come in that building.

[01:48:32]
I'm hungry.

[01:48:33]
Yeah.

[01:48:33]
I talked about pool.

[01:48:35]
Yeah. What's that?

[01:48:36]
Last time you and I were talking, you said you had a friend that makes pool cues.

[01:48:39]
Yeah.

[01:48:40]
Here's a chunk of mammoth. Ivory form. Wow.

[01:48:43]
This is my buddy, Eric Crisp. He makes sugar tree cues. This is beautiful, man.

[01:48:50]
That's good. Solid chunk.

[01:48:51]
That's a chunk of mammoth ivory. That's wild.

[01:48:54]
The exterior on that, the blue color is called vivianite. It comes from mineralization on frozen artifacts like that.

[01:49:01]
I'm gonna send him this.

[01:49:03]
Yeah.

[01:49:03]
And tell him to turn this into a Masterpiece.

[01:49:05]
Yep.

[01:49:06]
He makes incredible pool cues. And he does use mammoth ivory. He uses it sometimes in the joint.

[01:49:12]
Yeah. You said. You said you had one that had mammoth ivory in it. And what is that, Jamie?

[01:49:19]
Vivianite. Whoa. God, that's so beautiful.

[01:49:24]
That's. That's the mineralization you see on that. We find. It's actually easy to find bones sometimes because they're colored blue.

[01:49:31]
Really?

[01:49:31]
Yeah.

[01:49:32]
From mineralization.

[01:49:33]
Yeah.

[01:49:34]
Yeah.

[01:49:34]
I have some that are really, really blue.

[01:49:37]
That bison, the step bison skull that you gave me is Pete. That thing freaks people out. They're like, how old is that? Like, well, we have to get it tested. But it could be 10,000 years old.

[01:49:48]
That could be 40,000 years old. The one that was found over the hill from us, 38,000 years old.

[01:49:53]
Wow.

[01:49:54]
I haven't tested any of my step bisons.

[01:49:56]
Wow.

[01:49:57]
It's 400 bucks a pop. But I would bet that one's at least 20,000, 30,000 years old.

[01:50:04]
I. Whenever I have anybody on that's like, an ancient history expert, it's interested in, like, some of the lost civilization guys. We always talk about your place Because I'm like, that. That's a place where it seems like that's evidence that something took place there. That killed everything all at once.

[01:50:22]
Something came in hot, dude.

[01:50:23]
Something came in hot. And the way you describe it, too, that there's a layer of carbon. Where it looks like scorched earth.

[01:50:29]
Burt benrock. Burt gravel. You know, deep, deep, 50ft down. And since we talked last, I think I kind of figured some things out.

[01:50:39]
Yeah.

[01:50:41]
All that material that has ended up where we're at. Came in. I think we talked about it. Came in some kind of water event, Some flood. Yeah. And that's called the back channel to the. To the pay. What we're digging up. Pay out of. So there's a back channel that goes through that valley. That's pretty decent in gold. I mean, pretty rich. And the miners used to drift mine that. Because they couldn't bucket line dredge it. And so it goes around where we're at. And it keeps going downstream. So when we moved from where we were at down to. Let's go find the back channel. And we set up over here where we started on the left limit. We started going back up. And we found some drift mines up there. And I. This bone here, I think, was from an old drift mine A couple hundred years ago. You know, that before the discoveries were even made, Some guys were out there digging around. And had a. Had an old drift mine going yeah.

[01:51:39]
Because what did you date this to?

[01:51:40]
The date that's 200 years old?

[01:51:42]
And this is what kind of an animal?

[01:51:44]
Step bison.

[01:51:45]
Wow.

[01:51:45]
Either step bison or could be bear. I'm not sure.

[01:51:48]
How crazy is that? They were around 200 years years ago. You think that was a bear?

[01:51:53]
Could I. I'm not. I don't know what the.

[01:51:56]
Imagine the size of that thing. Like, that's his shin.

[01:52:00]
I don't know. You got. You got some experts in here, and they'll tell you what it is.

[01:52:05]
Yeah.

[01:52:05]
We call that the Spitzer bone.

[01:52:07]
Next time I got a biologist in here, I'll say, What do you think that comes from? It would have to be a very specific kind of biologist, Right?

[01:52:14]
A paleontologist worth his waiter. I mean, you should know. I'm not that.

[01:52:19]
How many more things have they discovered in the East River?

[01:52:24]
They haven't told me, but there is, I mentioned last time, a research vessel that was out there. And in this business, if someone makes a discovery on my property that's significant, they don't talk about it. They don't want anybody to know about it.

[01:52:42]
It.

[01:52:43]
But there was a discovery made not by Dirty Water Don or Dan. Don. He's still out there. And he's found all kinds of stuff.

[01:52:53]
He posts it on his Instagram. Stuff that he does find. And he's found it in the exact same place that you were told that the museum dumped it off.

[01:53:01]
Yep. And I posted a letter or part of that report that I was hoping that if somebody. I like people to think. Here's where it's located. Okay. Here's where it was dumped. And it said at the same point where they dumped it, where AMNH dumped it is where the New York City hospital dumped their stuff. How hard would it be to go to the hospital and go look at your records and tell me where you used to dump stuff in the 1940s?

[01:53:33]
Mmm.

[01:53:34]
Just find out. Just ask him. Amnh ain't gonna tell us.

[01:53:37]
Right. But if you know the location where Dirty Water Don found that stuff, it's got to be in there, right?

[01:53:42]
Oh, it's in there.

[01:53:43]
Can you go to his Instagram? Jamie? So how many different things has he recovered so far?

[01:53:49]
I think he's at least two mammoth and bison and a jawbone. It could be a horse. I haven't seen any of it. With my own eyes. I haven't.

[01:53:57]
And how much did they supposedly dump in that river?

[01:54:00]
50 tons.

[01:54:01]
That is so crazy.

[01:54:03]
And here's what I was going to tell you. Someone with A research vessel with side scanning sonar and all that stuff apparently. Found something. I found a mound in the river. It's a like a hundred. Drew probably knows better than me. 100ft long, 40ft high.

[01:54:20]
Whoa.

[01:54:21]
60Ft wide. Now that wouldn't be 50 tons, but it could be a whole bunch of other stuff. And that's why the report said this will be a significant challenge to future archeologists. This was written in 49 to future archeologists. And I'm going, wait, archeologists are human things. We're talking about paleontology, which is bone things. But AMNH is the one that called it archeological exploration.

[01:54:54]
So they have human bones as well?

[01:55:00]
Hypothetically.

[01:55:01]
So hypothetically, on your property they found human bones too and just dumped them in the river.

[01:55:06]
If you.

[01:55:07]
Why would they do that?

[01:55:11]
Why don't they. Why don't they come clean with the saber tooth tigers?

[01:55:15]
What do you mean by come clean with the saber tooth tigers?

[01:55:17]
Well, the experts out there will tell you that that saber tooth tigers weren't found in Alaska.

[01:55:23]
But you have found saber tooth tiger skulls.

[01:55:25]
Well, so are they. There's. I have a correspondence posted recently. Two pages that's filled with unbelievable things that. Yeah, that's one right there.

[01:55:40]
That's dirty water. Don says that this is the lower jawbone to a step bison.

[01:55:44]
Yep.

[01:55:45]
He's got some other stuff in there too, right, Jamie? Like maybe a tusk or something. Some other things.

[01:55:52]
Yep.

[01:55:52]
Yeah. Look at that bone. Step bison tibia. So what are you saying though? Why would they dump off human remains?

[01:56:07]
They say that. Well, the letter says we have yet to find any human remains. But we found spear tips. Well, we found mammoth bones with spear tips in them. We found that stuff.

[01:56:21]
Do you have a photo of a mammoth bone with a spear tip in it?

[01:56:24]
Yeah, my daughter's holding up a big mammoth hip bone and it's got a spear. Where's that bone, Rush? Alaska. I mean.

[01:56:32]
No, but where's it. Where can we see that image?

[01:56:34]
On my page.

[01:56:35]
On your page. Do you have that thing with the spear tip still in it?

[01:56:39]
Spear tips out, but we have the bone. We have two. We have a couple bones like that. Joe, why'd you take it out? In fact, I posted a picture of 12, or I think it's around 12 spear points that were sent to AMNH. That disappeared. shoot. Disappeared.

[01:56:55]
Well, you know what, I was talking to a guy the other day about this and he was saying that he thinks what happens is Dan Richards. That it goes to wealthy people. Oh, yeah, the wealthy people offer them a Bunch of money, wealthy donors. They want to get it for their collection. And he was talking about a bunch of different stuff that goes missing.

[01:57:15]
I have a letter I just posted here just in case we wanted to talk about it. From Childs Frick, who was head of AMNH back when this was all going on. His dad was Henry Frick. His dad was the most hated man in America for a while for killing his people. He was a steel guy. Steel. Steel industry founder.

[01:57:35]
Killing his workers.

[01:57:36]
Yeah, they wanted overtime pay and they didn't want to work so hard. And he brought in the gang, those hired thugs to the Pinkertons or oh really, whoever it was, and murdered people. I don't know how many they killed of his. His guys. He was ruthless. Henry Frick was ruthless. And his kid Childs was the one that set this deal up. This tripartite agreement, which is also included in this letter about AMNH's responsibility with these bones was to just take those of scientific value and do a report on every one they took. They took over 40 years. They took tons and tons and tons of them. Did no reporting nothing. Dumped 50 tons in the river because they didn't have a place to store them. Apparently didn't care.

[01:58:25]
But why would they dump human bones? Because it would think. I would think that that would be very valuable. You're saying archeology. So you think it's just. Just spear tips and shoot like that?

[01:58:38]
They found human bones. I'm willing to say that they found them.

[01:58:42]
It would also be very confusing if you found Alaskan spear tips in the East River. That would be the confusing thing for archeologists, I would imagine. They're saying too, kind of. Right.

[01:58:53]
Well, you find a. You find a bone with a spear tip situation in it or a bone that obviously had a spear tip in it because of the way it's broken. I mean, I have a baby mammoth hip bone that is like that.

[01:59:05]
Yeah.

[01:59:06]
Identified by reputable paleontologists.

[01:59:10]
Here's just a for instance. I stumbled across New York Times articles.

[01:59:13]
Talking about unearthing the secret of New York's mbutt graves.

[01:59:16]
Back from since the 19th century, hiring prisoners for 50 cents an hour the jail inmates paid to move mbutt graves. There would have been no markings of who was what.

[01:59:27]
Oh, so they dumped that in the river too.

[01:59:29]
Look where it is.

[01:59:31]
I mean, they just dump the bodies in the river. How gross.

[01:59:35]
They didn't use coffins until recently.

[01:59:38]
That's nuts. What about vampires?

[01:59:40]
Well, I mean, they put them in stuff, but like a real nice box.

[01:59:45]
Come on, man. Did you see Dracula Yeah, people are gross. You know, they've been throwing things in that river forever. You know, like most of the world, you go around rivers in most of the industrialized world. Those rivers are disgusting.

[01:59:59]
Well, our state legislature. I told you last time I was going to go political on this. I've got no desire to litigate this thing. Litigation just takes a long time politically. I told you last time we're going to go this route. And I have a letter I just posted from the Alaska State legislature to AMNH to return the bones from the Senate majority. The guy that wrote that's a fellow by the name of Click Bishop, and he was the Senate president, signed it with him. But Klick is a good, honest, decent, gold mining legislator. He was termed out this time and decided not to run again because I suspect he'll run for governor here and he'll probably win in a couple years. And Click is one of those guys that wants the boat back. We met with him and his chief of staff, the president of the university and the museum guys, and some other state legislators, and we want them back.

[02:01:09]
This is very interesting. We understand there are unopened crates sitting in storage in New York. They present an opportunity for further scientific discovery in fields such as paleontology, ecology and anthropology. Therefore, facilitating the return of this collection is crucial to ensure access for researchers, educators and students within Alaska, thereby advancing scientific knowledge and understanding of the state's natural history. There are researchers in Alaska ready and waiting to open these crates that have been collecting dust in your basement. Yeah, get at it. Give up the boxes.

[02:01:46]
Yeah, yeah, bring them home. Bring them home. Well, I made the offer to build the research facility, store everything. We'll bring them all back here. The scientists can have access to them. But the bones are not leaving Alaska. They're not leaving Alaska.

[02:02:03]
You don't trust them anymore?

[02:02:04]
freak no.

[02:02:04]
Why would you?

[02:02:05]
Why would I.

[02:02:06]
Why would I?

[02:02:06]
Don't.

[02:02:07]
It shouldn't.

[02:02:07]
And I get a lot of people, oh, I need a. I need a mammoth bone for Mike. Our studies. You're just trying to collect something.

[02:02:15]
Yeah, freak off. I'll never get it back.

[02:02:17]
Come on up and find it. Yeah, you know, come find them there. You know, they're all over the place.

[02:02:21]
That's what's nuts is that you keep finding them. Like, what was that event like that led so many bodies to be in this small area? Because you said it's only like five acres or something like that.

[02:02:32]
2.1.

[02:02:33]
2.1.

[02:02:34]
Yeah, we added maybe a point, another point. One.

[02:02:36]
But there's another area that you said that's a little larger.

[02:02:39]
Yes, downstream makes this one look like a piker.

[02:02:42]
How big is that area?

[02:02:43]
It's a mile long.

[02:02:45]
Whoa.

[02:02:46]
This is.

[02:02:46]
You're finding them there too?

[02:02:47]
Oh yeah.

[02:02:49]
So this main area we were pulling, most of this stuff is only 2.1 acres.

[02:02:53]
Yeah.

[02:02:54]
That's crazy. That is what a dump of bodies it must have been.

[02:02:59]
Yeah, it was incredible. So when we started back down at the mouth and headed up the left limit, we hit some fairly modern day drift mines on that side until we got farther up and we went all the way up to where we had been set up before and we crossed back over, tracing this back channel because that's where the gold was. We didn't get maybe 50ft and we find in these steel tubes sticking out of the ground. Well, that's how they used to melt permafrost. But this was virgin ground, it had never been mined. So we kept going and we found some pretty significant things over there and we're on the hunt.

[02:03:42]
I mean, imagine what the event must have looked like to lead all those bodies in one small area. I mean it only makes sense that that was a mbutt extinction event. Right. Am I wrong?

[02:03:54]
It went over thousands of years because we've dated anywhere from 40,000 year old bones to, you know, 12,000 year old bones in that deposit. Wow.

[02:04:06]
So everything kept dying there. So it might have been multiple events.

[02:04:10]
Yeah, might have been.

[02:04:11]
Well that was one of the things they thought about the younger Dryers impact theory. Right. They think there was multiple times where that happened. And then I wonder what the population density was like of animals back then too. Because we do have these enormous animals that are very difficult for predators to hunt and they manage to get into large numbers and they can defend themselves. Like if you have a large population of wooly mammoths and bisons and step bisons and freaking saber toothed tigers up there, what the freak did that look like? Like if you're finding that many bones, imagine going back in time 30,000 years ago and just being a fly on the wall and seeing what life was like back then.

[02:04:50]
Well, we can't seem to find anybody who's willing to come up there and study it. You know, I've made all these offers.

[02:04:56]
Because of the restrictions because they're scared that you're going to own everything and you're going to.

[02:04:59]
Well, the two of the employees at AMNH happen to have a conversation with somebody that is related to the state of Alaska. Employed by the state of Alaska where they Said we don't want the bones to get into Reeves's hands because they'll lose. The scientific community will no longer have access to them, and they're real valuable, and we think he's going to sell them. Now, the people that he said that to was with the other some Legislatures University employees. And where we were at, you couldn't even count the freaking number of tusks. And so here.

[02:05:44]
That's such an ignorant thing to say, because if you're going to sell them, you already have way more than you need to sell.

[02:05:50]
We're not. We're not there to sell tusks. I want to figure out. I'm goofball this way. What the freak happened? Why did 80, 65% of the world's megaphone are North America? Why'd it go all extinct all at once? Yeah, what the freak?

[02:06:08]
Yeah.

[02:06:09]
And they have in that collection that they didn't dump in the river in my collection was, let's say it's a 2,000 square foot or 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle. I got 42 pieces over here. They got the rest. I'm not gonna solve anything with 42 pieces. I want it all. Put it all back in Alaska. Let the state of Alaska study the freak out of it. And we will tell you how the extinction event happened. It's been. Paleontologists know that, but they don't have money. They don't really want to put up with the shoot they have to do to get it. You know how hard it is to dig in ice in permafrost?

[02:06:51]
Well, I see those hoses you use.

[02:06:53]
Yeah, but I'm not digging it, I'm thawing it.

[02:06:55]
Right.

[02:06:56]
Take a scalp. You know how the paleontologists see them on TV with the little scalpel and, you know, toothbrush and shoot. That don't fly around there. You got it, you got to melt it and get it the hell out of there. That's people criticized for how we do it. But if we don't do it, we don't get it. And we're not going to use mechanical equipment on it because I don't want to destroy it. I could strip that old 2.1 acres in two shifts and I'd lose every freaking bone. Could be smashed right. You're on a D10 across that stuff. They ain't gonna survive, man.

[02:07:32]
Of course, no, the way you're doing it seems like the only way to do it.

[02:07:36]
It is the only way to do it.

[02:07:37]
It's just all these paleontologists, they're all connected to universities, right?

[02:07:42]
They're all connected that way. And they don't want to piss off a human H because we can't hire this guy needs our grant money to do what he does or he needs to be our employee. Hey, here's one for, here's one for Elon Musk and his DOGE guys. Go check into those guys and see where their money goes. The amnh see where their money goes. The federal grants they get. See where that stuff goes. You know, might as well, because that's the only way you're gonna bring them to bring them in to heal. These guys been running unfettered forever. Nobody checks on it. The management's horrible. Nobody comes in and says, what'd you spend that 2 million on? I don't know. Look at that funny looking bird over there under. It's out of control.

[02:08:33]
Do you know this for a fact? Like, if you looked into it, do you know how they run or do you just. Just basing this on your interactions with them?

[02:08:39]
I'm basing on my interactions with them. But I will tell you this. One of the main people that you know, people say you need to litigate this, you need to sue their butt. I'm pretty good at that. I'm, you know, I've been involved in two of the longest lawsuits in state history and I've won both of them. So I'm betting like hall of fame kind of stuff. But the guy that made the deal with me is I can't depose him. You can't depose them. It's like be deposing a cabbage ahead of lettuce.

[02:09:18]
What do you mean?

[02:09:19]
He's like Biden.

[02:09:21]
Oh, he's gone.

[02:09:23]
That's what I hear. Oh, but he's still employed. He's still pulling in a pretty good paycheck to me that, you know, maybe you do that in the private sector, maybe you do it, but. And I don't know how much money that AMNH gets from the feds, but we looked into a little bit. They get some if, if they don't want to give Alaska the state of Alaska. If you look at who wrote that letter, it's not John Reeves now it's the state of Alaska. And I told, I told you it's the only way to get them back. We got to get our politicians up there going, no.

[02:10:02]
And are they willing to do this?

[02:10:03]
They just wrote a letter saying that what you supposed to do?

[02:10:06]
So what's the next step?

[02:10:07]
I don't know. We haven't Gotten a response from that freaking letter?

[02:10:10]
Do they have to respond?

[02:10:12]
Apparently not.

[02:10:13]
Yeah, that's part of the problem.

[02:10:14]
Right? freak these guys.

[02:10:16]
They're not accountable.

[02:10:17]
freak this dirt tramp up there.

[02:10:19]
They're the amnh. They're a prestigious institution. That's beyond reproach, sir.

[02:10:27]
And. And I said, I know, you know, if you have the politics lined up, right, and you see the right people where they should be, and you got people that want to just do. That's all I want to do is the right thing.

[02:10:38]
Right.

[02:10:38]
Just do the right thing.

[02:10:40]
Amnh. Is that where you go to see the dinosaurs?

[02:10:42]
Yeah.

[02:10:43]
Well, they do that. That's cool.

[02:10:45]
Yeah. Drew and I, my wife and Laura went to New York to meet with amnh, and they had to stand in the rain for four hours and then wouldn't meet with us.

[02:10:57]
Really?

[02:10:58]
Yeah.

[02:10:58]
Oh, yeah. He told me this.

[02:11:00]
Yeah.

[02:11:00]
Yeah. I'm not surprised you're a problem. They'd rather just avoid you then deal with whatever happened when they dumped 50 tons of bones in the east river and they have a bunch more just sitting there. What do you think they would discover if you got it all? What would, like, be. Best case scenario? You get all the bones back. Alaska wins.

[02:11:21]
Yeah.

[02:11:22]
You bring researchers over there. They work with you. What do you think they discover?

[02:11:26]
They discover what? Why all this megafauna? What happened? Why did the sea levels rise 400ft all at once? What went on here? There's animals that we found they said didn't exist there now.

[02:11:39]
They haven't amended that, even though you found those? That seems crazy to me.

[02:11:43]
They're doing a little backpedaling now, but what they need to do is put all the pieces of the puzzle on the table and start putting it together.

[02:11:52]
So you found. Tell me the animals that you found that are there, that aren't supposed to be there. Saber toothed tiger is one of them. Right.

[02:11:57]
Dire wolves.

[02:11:58]
Dire. Dire wolves. Wow.

[02:12:00]
Badgers, badgers, Badgers.

[02:12:03]
They're not supposed to be there.

[02:12:05]
We told you elk last time, and you pointed out there's an island that has some elk on it. Yeah, but they were planted there. They're. They're not.

[02:12:11]
Oh, they were?

[02:12:12]
Yeah. Elk were not known to be up in my neck of the woods.

[02:12:16]
Oh, no kidding.

[02:12:17]
And moose came in later, but they didn't even know moose was up there in that time. We found four of them. So moose were up there. And there was a transition from grbuttlands, which is good for the mammoth and the bison and the horses and the caribou to the woodlands where browsers could feed.

[02:12:39]
Right.

[02:12:40]
The mastodons, the mammoths. Or not the mammoths, the other animals that ate that kind of stuff. And the carnivores were having a field day, didn't they? Didn't care.

[02:12:48]
Right.

[02:12:49]
Who's eating what.

[02:12:50]
Do you think they brought in elk to hunt or do you think they brought him in to just to have them there?

[02:12:57]
I think no, they weren't brought in.

[02:12:59]
Check. How did elk get on a Fognack Island? 1929, eight cabs moved from Washington. Wow. Just eight. Washington. That makes sense because they're Roosevelt elk. That totally makes sense. Roosevelt elk are a larger bodied animal that has smaller antlers than a Rocky Mountain rose. Yeah. Roosevelt elk in Alaska. Originated from a transplant of eight calves. Captured Olympic Peninsula of Washington state in 1928. Moved to a Fog Neck island in 1929. Wow. That's crazy.

[02:13:30]
We find sheds of the antlers. Oh, yeah.

[02:13:34]
Wow.

[02:13:35]
And those are like thousands of years old.

[02:13:39]
Really?

[02:13:40]
Yeah.

[02:13:40]
So they were there already. Well, that's the thing about.

[02:13:43]
I came across country, right? Yeah.

[02:13:46]
In this country. They used to be everywhere and then people just wiped them out when they had market hunting. That's. You know what. When they made it illegal to sell wild game, that was the reason for it because everybody was poor. People were just killing everything they could and they almost wiped them out. They wiped out a lot of species like elk used to be in every state and now they're, you know, in a handful. They've repopulated them in some areas. Pennsylvania, Kentucky. There's been a bunch of success stories of repopulating elk to the point where they can hunt them now. But they used to be everywhere, including Texas.

[02:14:20]
Oh, yeah, that's. Oh, that's the one had a spear tip in it.

[02:14:24]
It really. Do you have a photo of it with the spirit?

[02:14:26]
I have a. Have a little video of it.

[02:14:29]
Where?

[02:14:30]
That's on my phone.

[02:14:31]
God damn it. Find it.

[02:14:35]
I'll find it.

[02:14:37]
I would never take that spear point out. I'd have that thing on display. That is the coolest thing ever.

[02:14:41]
Yes.

[02:14:42]
Spear point inside of a mammoth is.

[02:14:44]
Stuck right in it.

[02:14:45]
That's cool.

[02:14:46]
I have another picture up there if you want to pull that bison head up. The spear point in it still in it.

[02:14:52]
Really?

[02:14:52]
Right here.

[02:14:53]
Oh my God.

[02:14:54]
By the eyes.

[02:14:55]
Where's that?

[02:14:55]
Not that one. It was fairly recently, Jamie.

[02:14:59]
Oh, really?

[02:15:00]
That I posted it.

[02:15:01]
Yeah, without a doubt. My.

[02:15:05]
You're going the wrong way.

[02:15:07]
Well, there's the Trump thing. We should go read the comments. You're a terrible person.

[02:15:16]
Here's Click Bishop. He's the senator that sent the letter. Keep going.

[02:15:21]
Shout out to Click.

[02:15:22]
Yeah, it's in there somewhere.

[02:15:28]
How often do you post?

[02:15:30]
I posted these to make it easier for Jamie to find.

[02:15:32]
I'm like, I'm back months now. I was going back to the top of your feed. Is.

[02:15:35]
Was it months ago or was it recently?

[02:15:39]
Probably in the last week or two.

[02:15:41]
Oh.

[02:15:41]
Oh, I'm sorry. I gave you the wrong direction.

[02:15:49]
See it anywhere? Whoa. Look at that skull.

[02:15:53]
Yeah, keep going. That's a mammoth brain by those sunglbuttes.

[02:16:06]
Really? That's a brain?

[02:16:07]
Yep, half of one.

[02:16:09]
So was that mineralized?

[02:16:11]
It was frozen, dehydrated.

[02:16:14]
That's what that looks like. Wow. What'd you do with that thing?

[02:16:18]
It's in the freezer.

[02:16:21]
Right next to the frozen pizza. Go down next to the ice cream. Yeah, it's a mammoth brain. That's 30,000 years old.

[02:16:28]
There's another one that got hit by a spear.

[02:16:30]
Wow.

[02:16:33]
That's a. That's a little mammoth.

[02:16:35]
That's some freaking penetration right there, Jack. That's amazing. But where's this skull? Where's this skull?

[02:16:43]
There it is right there.

[02:16:43]
Where?

[02:16:44]
Right smack dab in the middle.

[02:16:46]
That one?

[02:16:46]
Yep.

[02:16:47]
Where's the point?

[02:16:48]
Right by the arrow.

[02:16:50]
Right by the arrow.

[02:16:51]
Yep. Go up right there.

[02:16:53]
Where?

[02:16:54]
Go where? The cursor was right there.

[02:16:57]
That's a tip?

[02:16:58]
Yep.

[02:16:59]
Whoa. So it's kind of mineralized too.

[02:17:02]
Yeah. Stuck right in it. Welded to its face.

[02:17:04]
Whoa. How could. How did you know that that's what that was? It looks like a tumor to me. Did you have to clean it up to see the difference?

[02:17:16]
Been cleaned up quite a bit. It's not bone, it's stone.

[02:17:19]
Wow. And you're gonna leave it in there like that?

[02:17:22]
Yep.

[02:17:23]
Did you get an X ray of it or anything so you can see it?

[02:17:26]
No.

[02:17:26]
Oh, I'd want to see that. That's amazing. What is it like being on a piece of land that at one point in time was just like this insane habitat? I mean, it must have, like some bizarre feel to just the land itself when you're pulling out saber toothed tiger skulls and wooly mammoth tusks and it just must feel insane that you're pulling all this stuff out of the ground that you live on?

[02:17:52]
Well, we live in the Ice Age. We go to work in the morning. We're in the Ice Age.

[02:17:57]
Yeah.

[02:17:58]
It's a different way to think. You see something, you go, okay, what the freak? What is this? You find something, you go, that's not human. I mean, that tool was made by human. If you go back.

[02:18:19]
But also, if you find humans, you gotta hug and keep it on the DL, I think.

[02:18:23]
So I would.

[02:18:24]
I would imagine. I don't know.

[02:18:26]
I don't know either.

[02:18:27]
I don't know nothing. But I would imagine if I found some humans, I wouldn't tell nobody.

[02:18:31]
Well, that we found that one tool that was obviously shaped by humans.

[02:18:35]
Right.

[02:18:35]
This. Carbon dated, 25,000 years old.

[02:18:38]
Wow.

[02:18:39]
And it looks like it was sod. And it looks just like if I was to take this cup, you know, you hold it in your hand just like something to mash anything with.

[02:18:53]
Right. Like a mold.

[02:18:54]
Right. Tenderized. There it is.

[02:18:55]
Get it right there.

[02:18:56]
Yep.

[02:18:56]
So that's a stone tool.

[02:18:58]
No, that's mammoth bone.

[02:18:59]
Mammoth bone.

[02:19:00]
But if you look on the next picture.

[02:19:02]
So the bottom of that thing was. Oh, wow, that's 25, 000 years old.

[02:19:06]
Yep.

[02:19:06]
And it sawed off at the bottom.

[02:19:08]
Yep, that's. If you look closely, you can see the. There's some kind of organic material in some of those cracks and crevices. You see some Schrager lines in there.

[02:19:18]
What is a Schrager line? Does that mean, like, saw?

[02:19:21]
That's a line in the mammoth ivory that's different than elephant ivory. Oh, you can tell with the difference.

[02:19:28]
And this was probably sawed off a long time ago. And now it's kind of fossilized. Right.

[02:19:36]
Without. Without any prompting. Joe, I've given that thing to other people to hold.

[02:19:43]
Huh.

[02:19:44]
You know, it sits like that. They pick it up. First thing they do, really. Just like, I know what this is.

[02:19:53]
So it's a tool.

[02:19:55]
Everybody picks it up.

[02:19:57]
Well, whatever it is, it's perfectly in your hand. It certainly seems like humans made it. There's no way you get something that's that flat out of nature. And it's not like those things snap off. They're not like elk antlers. They don't regrow them. Right.

[02:20:11]
Well, the. The other thing is, I said this last time, I'll say it again. We'd lived with wooly mammoths for tens of thousands of years. We know what that thing, what that tool is. It's in our DNA. First thing we do when we pick it up, boom, boom, boom. We don't feel like that about rats, people. Wooly mammoth. Little kids love them, parents love them. Everybody likes wooly mammoths.

[02:20:40]
You think it's our DNA because we used to hunt them?

[02:20:42]
freak no. We live with them. I Think we domesticated them?

[02:20:46]
What?

[02:20:46]
I think we live side by side with them.

[02:20:49]
Really?

[02:20:50]
I really do.

[02:20:51]
Why do you think they domesticated them? What makes you think that?

[02:20:53]
Okay, you got a big hairy animal, right? Boy, they got some like muskox. Let's get some of this and make clothing out of it. Let's take this fur, Right, but why that?

[02:21:05]
Why domesticate them versus hunt them?

[02:21:09]
You hunt them with a spear. I mean, you can knock one over if it's dead or you stick a spear in it crippled.

[02:21:15]
But do you think they actually kept them as like stock?

[02:21:18]
No, I think they just lived together.

[02:21:19]
They just lived together?

[02:21:20]
Yeah. They didn't. It's like that polar bear you saw walk up that guy's truck. That one man would go, what the freak you can do to me?

[02:21:27]
Right?

[02:21:27]
Well, if you want to kill half your tribe, go try to stick a spear in that guy, right? He's got 10 foot tusks, right? And clear the field.

[02:21:38]
And also you got to penetrate all that fur and all that hide with a spear. With a spear that you're throwing.

[02:21:45]
And people go, well, they had adolato. Okay, where are you gonna build a natladol on a grbuttland, right, where there's no sticks.

[02:21:53]
Well, how are they making a spear then?

[02:21:55]
Well, I don't know. How are they making a spear?

[02:21:58]
They must have some sticks.

[02:21:59]
That's what I'm saying. They didn't. They had spears if they had wood big enough for a spear. But atlatls are not spear size.

[02:22:07]
Well, it's a different shape certainly. But if you have enough wood to make a spear, wouldn't you have enough wood to make an atolatl? When's the invention of the atolatl? I don't know, let's find that out.

[02:22:17]
But if you had a spear that you crafted. We have a picture of spear tips that were sent to New York and they that document. Other document in there talks about finding them in buttociation with the bones. They weren't studying this stuff. They just wanted amnh, just wanted the booty. That guy Charles Frick wanted these things back in New York City.

[02:22:41]
So here's the 17,000 to 21,000 years ago. So if it's 25,000 years ago, it might not even be an adolato, but who knows how accurate they are with this? Like 20. I mean, that's a big gap. 17,000, 21,000 years ago. This is also people that didn't think that saber toothed tigers lived in Alaska. Right.

[02:23:02]
It's all artist renditions. All of the stuff that we've been taught is based on what somebody painted.

[02:23:08]
Or drove or sketched or they initially established. And now they've been defending that timeline.

[02:23:13]
Or even some of the cave drawings that shows people sitting on wooly mammoths. Really? Yeah. I've seen them before online. You know, if you. If you believe everything you see, like.

[02:23:22]
When Ted Nugent rode that buffalo on stage, like that kind of thing. That was good, but that kind of thing.

[02:23:29]
Yeah.

[02:23:29]
You know, like, they domesticated them. That's interesting. Well, we know humans have domesticated elephants. Right. And they did it a long time ago. And they wrote elephants. I mean, we know they do it in India.

[02:23:40]
Yeah. You wrote them.

[02:23:41]
Yeah, I wrote them in Thailand. I don't recommend it.

[02:23:44]
Yeah.

[02:23:45]
Just seems like it could go wrong.

[02:23:48]
Yeah, I don't think I. That'll be part of my thing.

[02:23:51]
Yeah. You make friends with them first. They have a whole process you do. You feed them, you give them sugar cane, you hose them down, take care of them. You be nice to them first. And then they let you ride them. But you got to be nice to them even when you're riding them. You have to have, like, good energy. They don't. I don't think they necessarily enjoy having a little human on their back. So it's like. It's their world. It just seems like a dumb idea. Like, I'm happy just petting you and giving you food. I don't need to ride you.

[02:24:19]
This is pretty badbutt looking.

[02:24:20]
Is that an Adolato?

[02:24:21]
I think this might be the one they found.

[02:24:23]
Whoa.

[02:24:24]
In France.

[02:24:25]
Wow.

[02:24:26]
Antler cargo.

[02:24:27]
Antler. Wow.

[02:24:29]
Who's a wizard that figured out how to make something to put extra leverage on a spear.

[02:24:35]
His name was Hook Musk.

[02:24:37]
That's the other thing that Dan Richards was bringing up. Like the fact that bow and arrow is a difficult thing to invent, but yet they invented it all over the world. Does that make sense? Or were people traveling from all over the world with the technology of the bow and arrow and spreading it around the world? He said that might make more sense than all these people from all these different spots all figuring out this complicated thing where you get a thing, you pull it back, you got a string, and you let loose, and the arrow has to fly. Perfect. And more likely someone figured it out in some place. And it was so awesome that they started spreading that idea across the world.

[02:25:14]
Yeah. And it takes a while back then to get the word out.

[02:25:17]
Yeah.

[02:25:18]
I mean, people had to travel to spread the word. They didn't. I Don't think they had smoke signals. Explain it in the sky.

[02:25:25]
I don't think you'd be able to explain a bow and arrow in the sky with smoke signals. I'm willing to go on a limb on that.

[02:25:30]
We come up with the expression the cloud. We use the cloud now. Yeah.

[02:25:35]
That was the original cloud. Smoke clouds. But I mean what did they send? Did they have a code when they had smoke signals or was it just the smoke itself?

[02:25:47]
Yeah, I had no idea.

[02:25:50]
So you found spear tips. Have you found arrowheads as well?

[02:25:54]
Not arrowheads.

[02:25:54]
Only spear tips. So it's more primitive.

[02:25:57]
Yeah. And the way we collect, we don't get all the small stuff, but we bail all the small stuff out of the drainage and we stack it so it can get. It can be gotten later. We don't lose any of it.

[02:26:09]
But you might have a bunch of like spearheads just laying around.

[02:26:13]
I bet we have millions of what I call microfossils. Millions, really? In the stuff that we bail with the equipment and just stack it up.

[02:26:21]
When you first discovered the saber toothed tiger head. When was that?

[02:26:28]
I found one in 1974.

[02:26:30]
That was the first one.

[02:26:31]
Yeah. But I was mining up north.

[02:26:32]
And when you found that, what was the reaction to that? Did it have the teeth in it and everything or was it just.

[02:26:38]
It had one full tooth and one broke in half. Really. And I. I think I told you the British Museum visited.

[02:26:46]
Yeah.

[02:26:47]
Guy after. To take it back and clean it and restore it and send it back to me. Never saw it again.

[02:26:52]
Of course.

[02:26:54]
The one that was sent to them.

[02:26:55]
How gross is that? That they just keep doing that same.

[02:26:58]
They do it all. That's what they do.

[02:27:00]
Yeah.

[02:27:01]
And in the last year.

[02:27:02]
Why should you have it? This is important for humanity. Some dirty gold miner.

[02:27:08]
The Smithsonian AMNH Got in trouble for grave robbery. Robbery robbing. Most museums have done that. They've taken artifacts from cultures and they just keep them.

[02:27:19]
So these people, they found this saber. They got this saber tiger.

[02:27:21]
Wow.

[02:27:23]
Look at that one.

[02:27:24]
That's a cave lion skull that we found.

[02:27:25]
Holy. Was that supposed to be there? The cave lion?

[02:27:30]
Yes, it was the only. That's the best one in. Ever found in Alaska.

[02:27:33]
Wow.

[02:27:34]
My son Kinsey and I found that together.

[02:27:37]
freaking A. That thing's amazing. Look at the teeth on that thing.

[02:27:41]
Yep.

[02:27:42]
So this saber tooth skull is probably very valuable that you found.

[02:27:48]
Yeah.

[02:27:48]
And because I've seen them for sale.

[02:27:51]
Right. Namnh says they don't have one. But we were going through the shipping records and we can see where they were shipped. One, the correspondence that I just posted talks about them getting them and camels and other, you know, other things that were sent that somehow disappeared.

[02:28:09]
Does Lorenzo Fertitta have a saber tooth skull in his office? See if that's true. Lorenzo Fertitta is one of the gentlemen who owned the UFC before they sold it to wme. Billionaire character, loved MMA and really was the reason why the UFC blew up along with Dana White and his brother.

[02:28:29]
Frank from a museum in Dallas.

[02:28:32]
Yeah, let me see what that looks like. I think it's like a lot of money. So if you think about your skull and this gets a hold of it, there's probably some over there that's really rich.

[02:28:43]
I was offered 85 grand for that one.

[02:28:46]
Yeah, yeah. Whoa. Holy.

[02:28:53]
Holy. shoot's right.

[02:28:55]
Holy. How freaking amazing must that thing have been to see live?

[02:29:02]
They got a bunch of mint La Brea Tar Pits. I mean, a bunch.

[02:29:07]
How much did Lorenzo Fertitta pay for the one doesn't say.

[02:29:10]
There's this article that had words that didn't have the picture of it.

[02:29:13]
Did you google Lorenzo Fertitta's and see images?

[02:29:17]
I mean, that's what. Yeah, that shows me other saber.

[02:29:19]
I can't.

[02:29:20]
What about that article? That first article? No picture of it. How dare you. Bloody elbow. You would think that a website called Bloody Elbow.com would really be on top of it. It was 15 years old. That's 2010.

[02:29:31]
2012 is when the article was posted.

[02:29:33]
Oh, wow.

[02:29:33]
There's $160,000 there.

[02:29:35]
What? It's only 160 grand.

[02:29:38]
Fossilized saber tooth type.

[02:29:40]
Oh, I thought it was like millions.

[02:29:42]
Could be small too. I don't know.

[02:29:44]
Yeah, I wonder what that one that was sold at the auction went for. How cool are those things though, man? Like, what a wild, amazing design that nature created. This is a whole skeleton.

[02:30:00]
40 million years old, it says.

[02:30:04]
Wow.

[02:30:07]
How many of you found up there of saber tooth skulls?

[02:30:11]
Two.

[02:30:12]
Just two. Wow.

[02:30:16]
Well, it's. It's when you come up, you let give me enough of advance notice and maybe send Jamie up in advance and we'll put a little.

[02:30:28]
Jamie never leaves his apartment. He's not gonna go to Alaska. Look at him. Oh, what's he gonna do with Carl? Can you bring Carl up there? Carl won't survive.

[02:30:35]
Carl get along just fine with our dogs.

[02:30:36]
He'll run off.

[02:30:38]
We'll put up a putting green for him.

[02:30:40]
He'll attack your dog. He's a little torpedo.

[02:30:42]
But put up a. You need to start Coming up there in the summer and we'll do.

[02:30:47]
Is that the move?

[02:30:47]
Some podcasts, the summer cast from Fairbanks, the Bone. The Bone Crew. Bring your friends with you. It'd be like, protect our parts, only parks. Only different.

[02:30:58]
Protect our parks in Fairbanks. That would be fun.

[02:31:00]
It would be fun.

[02:31:01]
That would be a good one. To do it at your area where you do it.

[02:31:05]
Put it in archive building, take a.

[02:31:06]
Day, tour the site. Yeah, it's just. I want more people to know about it. I really do, because I don't think I've ever heard of anything like that. I don't think I've ever heard of a spot like that where there's that many wooly mammoth bones and cave bear bones and all this shoot you're pulling out of the ground.

[02:31:27]
We have fun with it.

[02:31:28]
I mean, how many different dead animals? Like different extinct types of animals?

[02:31:34]
At least half a dozen. Wow. At least. I mean, it's just. I don't know. Because we have 300,000 fossils and you haven't examined all. Oh, freak, no. No. We only have time to pick them up. And maybe I'll take a picture, or maybe Drew will or one of my guys, my kids, my wife, somebody might take a picture of it. Or we'll take a picture of them holding it.

[02:31:55]
It seems like such a lost opportunity to know about things. And unless you're willing to give in to these guys who have obviously been deceptive with you in the past, how do you get real studies done up there? It's such a conundrum.

[02:32:09]
The bones ain't going anywhere.

[02:32:10]
Right.

[02:32:11]
If. If the timing ain't right, the timing ain't right. If the politics aren't right, I'm not. I'm not going to litigate this. It's not worth my time.

[02:32:22]
It's also, they've shown that they're not willing to be honest with you. The people with the British Museum that stole your sable tooth tiger skull. What's going on with the amnh? Like, why would you work with anybody when you don't have to?

[02:32:35]
No, I don't want to. If they're not going to play fair, I don't want to play with them.

[02:32:41]
It's such a freaking shame because it's an amazing site. It's such an amazing area that I would think that they would be flocking to try to work with you. Just do anything they can, just for the information. I mean, think of how many discoveries. First of all, the proven fact that saber tooth tigers lived in a place they didn't Think they live shift. That alone should be worthy of discovery. You need to take a leak. We can wrap this up.

[02:33:08]
No, no, no, no. I got stuff. I'm not done yet.

[02:33:10]
Oh, we're not done yet.

[02:33:11]
This is Dana skull.

[02:33:12]
Not Dana has one.

[02:33:13]
Yeah.

[02:33:13]
Oh, geez. Look at that thing.

[02:33:14]
So I read through the article and it was saying Dana. Dana bought it from a museum.

[02:33:17]
Holy. That's amazing. All right, we'll take a leak. We'll be right back. Dana White got an awesome skull. All right, we're back, sir.

[02:33:25]
Well, that pneumonia has a certain amount of recovery time, I'm sure.

[02:33:28]
How long is it?

[02:33:30]
Three months maybe.

[02:33:31]
Really? God damn.

[02:33:34]
Took 50 years for me to freak up my lungs. But I'm cleaning them up now.

[02:33:42]
Well, now's as good as time as ever. Just definitely better now than tomorrow.

[02:33:46]
It's the only time.

[02:33:47]
Yeah.

[02:33:49]
So where were we?

[02:33:51]
Dana White has a giant saber tooth tiger head in his office. And you were telling me you had topics that you wanted to cover that you brought notice.

[02:34:00]
Well, we were talking about the gas line.

[02:34:04]
Right.

[02:34:04]
Got that going.

[02:34:06]
No, there's no worry at all about the environment with these gas lines.

[02:34:09]
There always is. You're going to have people sue people. We don't want this.

[02:34:13]
We Alaska's, they're worried about environmental disasters. Right?

[02:34:17]
Yeah. But that oil pipeline has been running for a long time. Provides 12% of our country's gas oil. No problems. Well, we had a problem, you know, Fly reef.

[02:34:31]
What was that?

[02:34:33]
Exxon Valdez.

[02:34:34]
Oh, yeah, that was a big problem. Yeah, yeah, I remember that. That was 1988, right? Wasn't it?

[02:34:43]
Don't remember the exact date.

[02:34:44]
I think it was because I remember people were freaking out that that thing wrecked and emptied out a whole oil tanker. 89 Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran aground Bly reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound spill. Released more than 11 million gallons of crude oil. The largest oil spill in U.S. history at the time. But that's probably not nearly as much as that one that blew out in the ocean. That was just spraying oil.

[02:35:12]
Yeah.

[02:35:13]
I mean, that had a be. Yeah, probably more than that.

[02:35:16]
You're talking about the one in the overseas or the one here?

[02:35:19]
The one here.

[02:35:20]
Deep Water Horizon.

[02:35:22]
Yes, that one. How much did that release? That's what people are scared of, is.

[02:35:28]
Continuously releasing oil, natural gas for 87 days.

[02:35:31]
Jeez. Well, I brought you some goodies.

[02:35:36]
What'd you bring?

[02:35:37]
Well, some things that you can remind me of. The boneyard.

[02:35:44]
Okay.

[02:35:45]
We make. We got a little bag here for you too, Jimmy.

[02:35:53]
What do you got here, buddy?

[02:35:56]
Stuff.

[02:35:57]
Stuff.

[02:35:58]
Stuff that Drew and I make.

[02:35:59]
Oh, guitar picks. Oh, snap. Didn't we give one to Gary Clark Jr. Yeah.

[02:36:06]
Thank you for that.

[02:36:07]
Oh, my pleasure.

[02:36:08]
Thought you might want some more. With some little pendants, you can give them to your kids or whoever to put on a necklace. Those are pieces of mammoth ivory.

[02:36:15]
And how old do you think this little piece is?

[02:36:18]
That's a pendant that's probably 30, 40,000 years old.

[02:36:21]
Isn't that nuts?

[02:36:22]
Drew and I make those.

[02:36:24]
Doesn't it seem kind of crazy? There's so much of it, you're allowed to just carve it up and make stuff out of it.

[02:36:28]
We just use broken stuff. Yeah, we just. We have tons of broken tusks. They can't be restored. Complete tusks. We don't. We just restore them and then move on to the next one.

[02:36:41]
And most of them you just have stored. You must get a lot of offers where people want to buy them, right?

[02:36:46]
Yeah.

[02:36:48]
We tell them, go pound sand.

[02:36:49]
I don't tell them that. I just say, hey, go yourself. Got an image show.

[02:36:56]
I understand. Yeah.

[02:36:58]
No, I. I just don't sell tusks. I don't sell any bones. Not even a. Not even. I can give the stuff away because I own it. I can give it away, but I don't sell it.

[02:37:07]
Have there been anybody, any researchers or anybody in all these appearances that you've done on the show? It's sort of gotten that whole area a lot of attention. Has there been anybody that has expressed legitimate interest in working with you?

[02:37:23]
There has been expressions of interest, but they want to come up, and they have no place to study stuff. They want to send it all outside to their house and wherever, Their. Their university, wherever.

[02:37:38]
And you don't want that.

[02:37:39]
It won't come back.

[02:37:40]
Right.

[02:37:41]
And the work won't get done.

[02:37:42]
Right. Or at least it won't come back. At the very least, it won't come back.

[02:37:46]
Now, you recall last time I was here, I gave you some gun grips from the guy that makes those. Burkett Customs. Well, since then, he got into making firearms.

[02:37:57]
Oh, boy.

[02:37:58]
So he made it a. Drew and I. A couple 1911s. I posted those. Real nice that. He's getting into that.

[02:38:06]
Oh, look at that. Oh, and he uses your map.

[02:38:09]
Wow.

[02:38:09]
Look at those handles. That's crazy.

[02:38:11]
Isn't that something?

[02:38:13]
Now, is that the blue one? What is the. Is that the blue mineral line?

[02:38:17]
It's. Yeah, it's. That's a section of a mammoth tooth that's been cut.

[02:38:22]
Wow.

[02:38:22]
And the one on the bottom is mammoth tusk.

[02:38:25]
And so the mammoth tooth has been cut. Is that the natural color of it? That blue?

[02:38:29]
No, I think he. I think he might have put a little coloring in it.

[02:38:31]
Oh, wow.

[02:38:32]
That's in the epoxy. Isn't that something?

[02:38:34]
That is beautiful.

[02:38:35]
And he got our name on the guns, too.

[02:38:37]
Wow.

[02:38:38]
And the logo. Now, we can say we were insured by Burkett.

[02:38:43]
But don't rob a bank with that gun, because they're gonna know who you are.

[02:38:47]
Yeah, they got cameras that'll tell them.

[02:38:49]
That's pretty dope.

[02:38:51]
Anyway, so he did that. And then the other guy who you both have carvings from, Chuck Leak is his name. And you know that one thing that you have, the. The pipe with the tusks?

[02:39:06]
Right.

[02:39:07]
I don't think you've ever used it. No, that's his kind of stuff.

[02:39:11]
Oh, I see.

[02:39:12]
So he knew I was coming on your show, and he goes, can I make you and Joe a special carving, then? Can you give Joe his when you see him? I said, yeah, I'll give it to him when I go down there. So I brought it to you. It's here in this box. This is the kind of stuff.

[02:39:34]
Okay. Thank you.

[02:39:36]
Yes.

[02:39:36]
All right. I'll open it right now.

[02:39:38]
Yeah, open it right now. Yeah.

[02:39:39]
All right.

[02:39:40]
Anyways, his name's Chuck Leak. Probably the best ivory carver on the planet. There's a picture of him carving a. He carved a letter opener for the Pope. There's a piece of tape there in the middle, Joe, on the front, right where your hand is.

[02:39:52]
Oh, I see it.

[02:39:53]
Might have to cut it or something.

[02:39:58]
Yeah.

[02:39:58]
There we go.

[02:40:00]
Whoa. This is crazy. What is this?

[02:40:05]
Mammoth tooth with a mammoth carved into it.

[02:40:08]
That is incredible. Look at that. The size of that tooth is insane.

[02:40:16]
Yep.

[02:40:17]
It's so heavy.

[02:40:18]
Yep.

[02:40:20]
My God. That's amazing carving, too. Oh, look at that. That's so beat. That Will, stay here. Right here. I'm gonna clear off a spot for it.

[02:40:29]
Yep, there we go.

[02:40:31]
Right here. That's sick. That's amazing. That'll go right next to your other bone. Thank you very much. That's incredible. What's his name again?

[02:40:41]
Chuck Leak.

[02:40:42]
Chuck Leak. Shout out to Chuck Leak.

[02:40:44]
Mammoth mogul.

[02:40:45]
That's incredible.

[02:40:46]
Instagram.

[02:40:46]
Part of me feels bad that he carved into this tooth, because I kind of just would rather have the tooth, but the art work itself is insane.

[02:40:54]
We can arrange that, Joe.

[02:40:55]
Well, I like it by itself, too. I like the. The art, too, but it's just like. I just feel weird about people carving into stuff that's so valuable and ancient.

[02:41:04]
I've had him make me one for every animal that we found. He's got him with horses.

[02:41:11]
Jamie, you got to pick this up. Feel how heavy this is. This is so crazy.

[02:41:16]
Here, Johan, hand Jamie this too.

[02:41:18]
It's a two.

[02:41:24]
It's crazy.

[02:41:24]
It's crazy. That's a tooth. How big were these?

[02:41:29]
Huge. That's a. That's probably an adult female.

[02:41:34]
That's amazing.

[02:41:36]
Yep.

[02:41:37]
Yeah. And they want us to believe that hunters wiped all those out.

[02:41:40]
No way.

[02:41:40]
Spears shut the up.

[02:41:42]
No, they. Anyways, Truck has made every. For every animal that we found out there, he's made a. Taken a mammoth tooth and carved the animal inside it just like that.

[02:41:52]
Oh, wow. Including saber toothed tigers. Wow, look at that one. That's incredible. Amazing work. It's really good.

[02:41:58]
Well, I want to get the saber toothed tiger back right now. I can't seem to find it. One museum stole one and I think the other museum stole one too. So one museum stole one, The British Museum stole one. The one where AMNH says they never got one. But the correspondence that's listing there talks about him being shipped to New York. Talks about the agreement we had with amnh.

[02:42:24]
Oh, it never got there. Sorry.

[02:42:28]
Auto Geist was a scumbag that collected for him. He was a railroad field hand. Now he ended up with a doctorate in anthropology from the University of Alaska. Who was in on this whole deal?

[02:42:39]
Well, I would guarantee that if I lived in like 1920 or some shoot like that. And I knew that one of my buddies that I've been donating to his museum was about to get a saber tooth tiger headed. And I wanted that for my house.

[02:42:55]
You'd have it.

[02:42:55]
You'd probably make a little deal.

[02:42:57]
Of course you would make a little deal.

[02:42:59]
I'll give you a million dollars in grants and next thing you know you have people over for a cocktail party. Come into the lounge. I want to show you something I acquired.

[02:43:09]
I have a letter posted of what I consider pretty interesting way to offer a bribe back in. Back in the day.

[02:43:17]
Really?

[02:43:17]
Yeah, it's posted.

[02:43:19]
What was the. How did they do the bribe?

[02:43:20]
It was a letter from Charles Frisk to the president of the University of Alaska. And a sentence that got my attention was, well, first of all, you invited them to join him and his wife in New York City for a night at the mansion. And then the last sentence was, and we can discuss things. That man always needs more of well, you don't buy that. You rent that.

[02:43:51]
Gold goals. What does man need more of?

[02:43:57]
I would say money.

[02:43:58]
Yeah, it has to be that. Yeah, it has to be. He's offering him what man needs more of. Yeah, that's a nice way of saying it.

[02:44:05]
Back in the day, they were. It was a king's English. They talked proper and all that stuff.

[02:44:11]
Yeah. Like I said, Dan Richards brought that up, that he thinks that that's what happened to a lot of ancient Egyptian artifacts. And they're probably scattered all over the country or over the world, rather, in the hands of wealthy collectors. Makes sense. You know, people always want to have something that is very rare and that they're not supposed to have, you know.

[02:44:33]
And we all collect stuff, you know. What do you collect? What is your favorite thing to collect?

[02:44:38]
Pool cues.

[02:44:39]
Pool cues. There you go.

[02:44:40]
I love pool cues. They're functional artwork for a game that I'm completely addicted to.

[02:44:48]
I. I think he'll be able to make a few out of that.

[02:44:53]
Yeah. Oh, he definitely will.

[02:44:55]
I don't. I don't know.

[02:44:56]
Go to get a photo of Sugar tree cues. He's.

[02:45:01]
If he turns it on a lathe or whatever.

[02:45:03]
My friend Eric, he goes out into the woods and gets his own wood. Like, he does everything from the bottom to the. To the final production of it. He's a really rare guy. Guy because his cues, he make, like, there's a lot of cues. They make them real fancy with a bunch of different inlays and different stuff. But what he uses mostly is just the natural beauty of the wood itself. He's like. He loves wood. And so his key. Like, look at that. Look at the burl on that handle. I mean, my God, that's so gorgeous. And that's just nature's gorgeousness. That's nature's artwork. And that's what Eric makes. Most of his cues, like, they're. It's all nature's artwork. And they also play incredible. He's a really good pool player, too, which is kind of important if you're going to be a guy who makes cues. Like, click on that link right there where you just had AZ Billiards. Right there. That one. That's some of his work right there. Like, it's all so beautiful.

[02:45:58]
Holy.

[02:45:59]
Yeah. And it's like I said, you see how his work, it just really highlights the beauty of the wood itself. And they play really good, too. That's the thing about pool cues. They all play different, but his. They all have a lot of feel to them. Like that one right there by your cursor right there. It says Facebook. That click. Yeah, right there. Look at that thing. Look how beautiful that handle is.

[02:46:21]
I can't imagine the work that goes into making one of those.

[02:46:24]
Oh, it's a lot of work. But it's also that the gorgeousness of it is just natural. Just natural wood. So I'll send him this stuff. He uses mammoth ivory.

[02:46:35]
I got more if he needs more. You know, I. I don't know what size he needs or how thick it should be.

[02:46:40]
I don't know either. I'll ask him.

[02:46:44]
My daughter's Elora, who's married to Drew out there. She makes the jewelry. Last time where we talked, it said she was Saks Fifth Avenue. She's gone beyond Saks Fifth Avenue. Drew and I are still muddling around in the Dollar General with what we do. We're just making a lot of stuff that people like, like the guitar picks and the ball markers and the pendants. But she takes gold nuggets that she finds and uses ivory that she finds and puts it all together in some beautiful jewelry. And I'm plugging her. It's my daughter, Elora Longley does.

[02:47:20]
Yeah, you showed it to us the last time. It's really beautiful stuff.

[02:47:23]
She made that necklace for you.

[02:47:24]
Yeah. And again, that stuff is like you're dealing with something that's 30,000 years old.

[02:47:31]
It's amazing, the shine on that wood. You put that on there, and you can shine it to a mirror finish. You can see your face in it.

[02:47:37]
That's wild.

[02:47:38]
It is.

[02:47:39]
It's just also so cool to be in possession of something. Like, just. Just to hold this in your hand and to know that this is a part of an animal that roamed the earth 30,000 years ago. Pretty incredible stuff.

[02:47:50]
It is.

[02:47:51]
When you're walking around that area, do you get a sense of it? Like, does it feel weird when you're walking around there?

[02:47:56]
It does, because the stink. The stink is incredible, Right.

[02:48:01]
Because it's all rotting, right?

[02:48:02]
Yeah. We go in in the morning, there might be a wolf or a couple coyotes or a lynx or two just kind of rooting around in there going, hey, come back later.

[02:48:12]
Just smelling the rot.

[02:48:13]
Yeah. They're looking for it, and they find it, and they find bones. They'll come up to our pallets and take bones right off of of them.

[02:48:19]
Wow.

[02:48:19]
And they chew them. Like, they'll chew chunks out of them. It's incredible. You know, the stink is unreal.

[02:48:27]
And if it wasn't frozen, that's probably what happened to most of the bones that were left behind by all the animals that didn't get. That didn't die.

[02:48:33]
In permafrost we have bones that have tendons still attached. Wow. And.

[02:48:37]
Well, you were telling me about a guy who ate some of the. Oh, yeah, he ate some old meat.

[02:48:42]
Yeah. Off a Blue babe, which was 38. The other bison I said was 38,000 years old.

[02:48:49]
Yeah, they talk about dry, aged.

[02:48:51]
Yeah, they had us. Well, you know, we all eat that. He had a stew made out of it.

[02:48:57]
What was it like?

[02:48:59]
I talked to him at the boneyard. He came out there. He's up in years now, but Dale Guthrie, I believe his name is, and he wrote a book on it on ice age stuff. He made a big old casting of a wooly mammoth that I bought. Not from him, but he sold it to somebody who sold it to a. Another guy I knew who had it for sale.

[02:49:21]
And he made a stew out of old bison meat.

[02:49:25]
Yeah, they found the whole bison. A mummified bison. If you saw that little. There it is. Wow.

[02:49:33]
Dinner party that served up 50, 50,000 year old bison stew.

[02:49:37]
And I think it's 38, 000, but that's all right. Wow. Dale Guthrie. You know the guy's name.

[02:49:43]
I would have had to take a bowl of that. I would have to try it.

[02:49:48]
Will you come on up? You come on. I want to try.

[02:49:50]
I would try it last. I let a bunch of other eggheads try it first and stare at them. How you feeling? What else are kind of diseases are in that bison bone that you're thawing.

[02:50:01]
Out now I'm going to go heavy duty on this carnivore diet.

[02:50:04]
You should.

[02:50:05]
Yeah. Nothing but bison and mammoth.

[02:50:07]
Yeah, it will. It'll definitely radically decrease your hunger. To make the stew for roughly eight people, Guthrie cut off a small part of the bison's neck where the meat was frozen while fresh. When it thawed, it gave off an unmistakable beef aroma, not unpleasantly mixed with a faint smell of the earth in which it was found. With a touch of mushroom, he once wrote, then added. They then added a generous amount of garlic and onions along with carrots and potatoes to the aged meat. Couple that with wine, it becomes a full fledged dinner. They show a photo of what the dinner looked like. They didn't take pictures back then?

[02:50:46]
No.

[02:50:47]
How do you not take pictures of your food?

[02:50:50]
I told you the story of the guy that found that.

[02:50:52]
Wow.

[02:50:56]
Not a good. It wasn't a good look.

[02:50:58]
Yeah.

[02:50:59]
But they closed his Mine down. They extra take that out, you know. They were supposed to get it out that day. And it took them all summer. The miner got shut down just because of this bison? Yeah.

[02:51:11]
Yeah.

[02:51:13]
He went over to a different creek, I think I told you this called no Gold Creek. I don't think there's any gold on no Gold Creek didn't have a good.

[02:51:20]
Winner because he couldn't go to the other place because of the bison.

[02:51:24]
Yeah.

[02:51:25]
That's a pain in the butt.

[02:51:26]
Ron. Roman's his name. He's a.

[02:51:28]
Was there any other way to do it? Was there a way to work around it?

[02:51:31]
That was the only other ground he had. He. They tied up the whole thing. I mean they. You're done. Then when they're done, he went back in.

[02:51:41]
But is it his land?

[02:51:43]
Yeah, it was patented land that he had. It was my company land. He was on my ground.

[02:51:48]
And they have the ability to shut things down for discovery like that?

[02:51:51]
Yes, they did.

[02:51:52]
How come they don't have the ability?

[02:51:53]
He was a nice guy and they.

[02:51:55]
Said, let him do it.

[02:51:56]
We're gonna get in here. We'll take us a day to get it out. He said, go ahead.

[02:52:00]
I see.

[02:52:01]
And then they said we, we can't do. It's the whole thing.

[02:52:03]
And then they could never get him out of there.

[02:52:05]
They took it out. Took him all summer to get it.

[02:52:07]
And then it freaked him.

[02:52:08]
Yeah. You only get. You only get 100 days to mine where the water turns to ice.

[02:52:13]
Right.

[02:52:13]
If you're not mining, then you're done. So every day is a 1% day.

[02:52:17]
Oh, that's terrible.

[02:52:18]
Or 10%. You know, it's like every day.

[02:52:21]
So that must have been terrible financially for him.

[02:52:23]
Oh yeah, it was horrible. He had nothing but pork and beans all winter. He's the one that found the wooly mammoth.

[02:52:32]
And is there any other way to mine, to mine around that. Where you're not going in that one area.

[02:52:38]
If you rely on somebody telling you.

[02:52:40]
What you can and can't do, we'll.

[02:52:42]
Get back in here. You can be back here day after tomorrow. Anybody, any miner that I know would say, okay, right, come do it. I know I'm gonna lose a day, but we'll work on equipment that day. But if you come back in the day after tomorrow and they say, sorry, we're gonna be here for a few.

[02:53:00]
Months, what would you do?

[02:53:03]
I wouldn't tell them I found the thing.

[02:53:06]
Because you have experience with these kind of people.

[02:53:08]
Yeah, I, I would. I, you know, I can't Even. It's. It's not like I'm keeping this discovery a secret, people.

[02:53:16]
Tell me how many Instagram follows you have.

[02:53:19]
500 and over 500,000.

[02:53:22]
Yeah. It's not a secret. Let's see how much it is after today, too.

[02:53:25]
Well, I appreciate you doing this because it gives us a. An ability to get the word out.

[02:53:29]
Yes.

[02:53:30]
And it's important to get the word out to get the other things to fall in place.

[02:53:34]
Yeah, I think it's important too.

[02:53:36]
And I appreciate the fact that you. You enjoy the shoot out of this prehistory stuff.

[02:53:41]
Dude, I do. I love it. And I also love the way you're handling it. I think it's. It's. We're very fortunate that a guy like you owns that piece where you're willing to talk about it publicly and make a stink about it and let everybody know like there's a real part of the puzzle in the history of this earth. That's right there.

[02:54:00]
It's not that even that complicated a puzzle. The puzzling part is what the freak is AMNH doing? They've had those bones in their basement for a hundred freaking years. They were required in the original deal to do a report on every bone they took. And they were only supposed to take bones of scientific value. This bone has no scientific value to them. They took it. This bone has no scientific value to them. They took it. None of the bones they took have scientific value, primarily because they don't know where they found them. I have all that information in my files. I have all the stratigraphic information of everything they found. Don't you guys think you ought to weld it to me?

[02:54:42]
Yeah.

[02:54:42]
And we'll say, well, this bone came out of 35ft on woodchopper Creek, Coldstream Creek, Miller Creek, whatever creek it came off.

[02:54:52]
So you. You could be able to find the exact locations and where it was dug.

[02:54:55]
Yeah.

[02:54:56]
So let me ask you this. You know, in a best case scenario, what would happen? They would give you the bones back, and then what would you do?

[02:55:04]
The experts would come in after I built a facility where they study them. I understand they're not gonna. We have a. We have a lab in San Francisco. We're gonna send the bones to San Francisco. We'll have a lab here. I'll build the. I've already offered this up to him. And they still don't jump on the chance. How many dumb shoots are around like me?

[02:55:27]
Maybe you have to build it first. And they will come. Like the field of dreams.

[02:55:31]
Yeah, that Was a movie, by the way. I love that movie.

[02:55:35]
It's a good movie.

[02:55:36]
But I. I've learned my lesson on if you build it, it will come. Yeah, because we built. We just built one. They didn't show up. So we use it. We use it for our own purposes.

[02:55:50]
Well, maybe we could put the bat signal out here on this show. And there's got to be some paleontologists that are absolutely fascinated by this, that are willing to figure out a way to make it work.

[02:56:03]
You just can't take the bones out of Alaska. And they got to be like, no bullshoot researchers, scientists, people that know what they're talking about, because I don't.

[02:56:13]
They're gonna want it for museums. Huh?

[02:56:16]
They can't have it.

[02:56:17]
Right? But that's probably what's gonna, like, if they do find some extraordinary stuff. The way they get value out of that is by putting it on display, doing studies on it, and then putting it on display so people can come pay money to see it. Right.

[02:56:29]
If I go to amnh, let's say every day for every once a week for 52 weeks, it's the same displays every week. So all the stuff they collect doesn't go on display. It goes down in the storage or it goes out in the East River. The deal with my company, the nozzlemen, they called them. There were 200 guys working giants. And the giant guys, the nozzle guys, part of the perks of working for that company was if you find a tusk, you can have it. They could take the tusks home with them.

[02:57:04]
Really?

[02:57:05]
Yeah. And the skulls and whatever else they found.

[02:57:07]
No one cared back then.

[02:57:08]
Nobody cared. The company didn't care. Take them. And then these guys from New York, the swift talking city dudes, they come in and go, oh, we want them. So they made it so the men couldn't take them and they took them all scientific value, nothing. They took them all. Well, let's just imagine you're the grandson of one of the old style nozzlemen who's now dead. But he pbutted that tusk along to his kid, and now it's yours. That tusk could be worth $200,000. That could come in handy to that family. Maybe they could have used that money along the way instead of not having it.

[02:57:46]
Instead of the M and H just having it in their basement.

[02:57:49]
And the letter that is on there talks about hundreds, hundreds of tusks that were shipped there. I've seen them. It's not like I'm making this shoot up. I was down There, I took pictures of them.

[02:58:02]
You were down there in the basement?

[02:58:04]
In the basement. It's incredible. These. These big crates haven't been opened ever.

[02:58:10]
And they're just filled with tusks.

[02:58:12]
Well, the tusks are on these big shelves like you see at Costco. They go way up high. Yeah, just shelves of shelves and bison heads and stuff. And then the crates are the bones, leg bones, teeth.

[02:58:26]
How the freak can they just leave that there?

[02:58:29]
It's in storage.

[02:58:30]
That seems so insane that you have this extraordinary place that really doesn't get attention until you get on social media. And then the world knows about it, but they've known about it for a hundred years. Like, that seems like something you would want people to know about.

[02:58:44]
Nobody gave a shoot. My company didn't care until, you know, they didn't envision a guy like me come along and owning this company. They had. No, no. When I. When I bought the company, I started going through the files, going, let's see what I bought. You know, like the. Let's see what. Oh, look at that. I got a lease with the government. Oh, here's another one. I got another lease with the government. Yeah, I got a piece over here, guy offered to buy. Now I don't want to sell it. So I go through all these things and I found the deal with the bones and I went to the museum. I said, I bought Alaska Gold Company. I want to go get the bones. He goes, I was wondering when you're going to show up. Off to New York we go. Got bullshootted. Oh yeah, we're going to return them when we. After we take care of the asbestos abatement problem up down there. Anyway, I told you all this and they have yet to get a hold of us. It's gone to our state legislature to see if they can help. It's coming back to Alaska.

[02:59:43]
Those are my bones. And if they're afraid that it's going to go, well, Reeves, you know, they're worth a lot of money. You know, he. He could sell them. Look, just send them back and if I want to sell them, I'll sell them. They're my bones also.

[02:59:57]
You haven't sold what you have. It doesn't even make any sense.

[03:00:00]
It's a freaking hobby. You know, we're all queer for some. Something, you know, some people collect stamps, some people collect coins. My mom used to collect napkin there, you know, quilts and stuff like that. I collect bones in historic sites. I like his. Well, I got a degree in history. You probably didn't know that. Historic preservation, I like to fix up old. Talking to a guy about Nenana, which. Where the golden spike was driven by Harding that just went up for auctions on Christie's.

[03:00:38]
What is that? Explain that.

[03:00:40]
A golden spike railroad spike that Warren Harding came up and drove in the. In the railroad back in the 20s when they completed the Alaska Railroad from Anchorage up to Nenana, which is.

[03:00:52]
How'd they keep someone from stealing that?

[03:00:54]
Well, they didn't leave it in there long. Oh, they drove it in, they took the photo op. They did all that, then pulled it out. Pulled it out and somebody bought it. And somebody else bought it.

[03:01:03]
Whoa, look at that. That's crazy. Wow.

[03:01:09]
So I did some figuring on the weight of it and figured how much gold content was in it.

[03:01:16]
$200,000?

[03:01:18]
Yep.

[03:01:19]
Wow.

[03:01:21]
The museum, it was only valued at like 30 to 50, but just the.

[03:01:26]
Historical significance of it makes it worth 200 grand.

[03:01:29]
Yeah. And. And I know the guys that bought it. I was on the. I was on the auction, I had the guy on the phone and it didn't take long for me to go past and I ain't buying it. I don't want it. And it kept going and kept going and kept going.

[03:01:41]
What'd you think it was going to stop at?

[03:01:43]
I was going to stop it around 70. It kept going. It kept going. It kept going.

[03:01:49]
Well, that's probably the same kind of thing that happened with your saber toothed tiger skull.

[03:01:52]
Oh, freak. That was given away to somebody.

[03:01:54]
You think so? Oh, you don't think somebody gave him money for it?

[03:01:57]
Oh, they gave money, but it wasn't sold. It was like a donation. I'm a benefactor. Here's right. Here's for the new wing, right? What do you got? You got any of that Egyptian stuff laying around? Yeah, I want a sarcophagus. What do you say, boys?

[03:02:09]
I bet there's a ton of old school families that have, like deep old school money that have stuff like that squirreled away somewhere.

[03:02:17]
Well, you can. They're always getting arrested for stealing. Mostly they're museum employees. If you. If you ever Google, it's. It's amazing what these guys steal from the. From the. Oh, yeah. Museums aren't money makers, right? You're going to make money. You're not going to go own a museum. You know, you're going to go do whatever you do to make money. But museums don't make money. So the guys that work there, they go out in the field and some guy says, well, look what I found. Well, that's very interesting. That looks like a saber tooth. I mean, it looks like just a cow head. Well, can you find out for me?

[03:02:55]
Sure.

[03:02:55]
I'll take it off your hands.

[03:02:57]
Yeah.

[03:02:58]
And off he goes.

[03:03:00]
Who's got the bones? Timeline reveals Park Service employees covered up theft of ancient remains. Case of missing bones from the Effigy Mounds National Monument. Took multiple investigations, more than 20 years to locate them.

[03:03:14]
Wow.

[03:03:15]
I'm not shocked.

[03:03:17]
Well, we got a site in Florida that we've allowed the University of North Florida to dig on for decades. It's on a Indian mountain there, right on the St. John's River. And every year I allow them to come out and dig. And they found. So far, they've found hundreds of thousands of artifacts. We're talking about archeological stuff. You know, arrowheads, sharks, teeth with drilled holes through them, jewelry, beads, you name it. Whatever they made out of fish bones and animal bones.

[03:03:48]
And how do you wind up always finding these spots to park at where it turns out there's a bunch of ancient stuff in them?

[03:03:57]
I didn't. My parents bought this property when I was young guy, but I spent a lot of time as a 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 year old kid just digging. I like digging in the dirt. And the Alaska stuff was about gold. But it didn't take long to find the bones and the bones, to me, they're more fun. They're more, you know, they're not worth anything to me because I don't sell them.

[03:04:21]
Another scandal that the MNH was involved.

[03:04:23]
In recently facing scrutiny. A museum that holds 12,000 human remains changes course. American Museum of National History said it would address its collecting of remains which stretched into the 1940s and including practices now viewed as abusive and racist. So it must be Native American bones. Wow. I like how they put it. They're planning to overhaul their stewardship of more than 12,000 human remains. Painful legacy of collecting practices that saw the museum acquire the skeletons of indigenous and enslaved people taken from their graves in the bodies of New Yorkers who died as recently as the 1940s. Wow. They probably got reconstruction of a burial of a warrior from mongolia in about 1000 A.D. wow. They decided to remove that.

[03:05:20]
I mean, that's just a picture, but.

[03:05:21]
I can leave it there. What are you doing? I just want to go look.

[03:05:24]
They were obviously doing some stuff.

[03:05:26]
Oh, they're not. They're not the only ones doing this. Smithsonian's doing this stuff too, I'm sure. And there's not much I can do about it. I mean, it's well, especially.

[03:05:39]
There's no argument if they've had it sitting on their shelves for all this time.

[03:05:43]
And I've offered to make this happen. Make it. Let's get it back here. It's, you know, an endless, you know, tilt in the windmill and all that stuff. But, you know, I never met you before a few years ago. And prior to that, I would just say the only guy I'll talk to is Joe Rogan about this. Because if I'm gonna talk to anybody, I'm gonna talk to the most influential man on earth. And you weren't supposed to call me, but here I am for the third time.

[03:06:12]
Listen, of course I was supposed to.

[03:06:14]
I'm fascinated because I didn't want to tell this story. I just wanted to keep boning. And now that it's going, everybody wants me to do all this freaking work. I'm not a research scientist. I don't have all these machines. I can't do all this stuff. What are you asking me for? Go to amnh. That's their job. That's what they got paid to do. What are you chewing my butt for?

[03:06:36]
Well, best case scenario, as we described, they give it back to you. Researchers get involved, you build a facility on site, they study it, everybody learns, everybody's happy.

[03:06:47]
That's right.

[03:06:48]
Yeah.

[03:06:49]
And we have some knowledge at the end of the day.

[03:06:52]
Yeah.

[03:06:52]
That we don't have now, we won't get if we don't do something like this. Because all my bones come from one little two acre spot. And you talk about in situ, you know, in place. It's right there.

[03:07:04]
Yeah.

[03:07:04]
You can't find a bone here and find one nine miles away and somehow say they're from the same area, but you can sure find them there. And you can find out where they exactly came from. You can figure out what that, that piece you're holding. You can tell how many times that cool, male or female, what its diet was, where it traveled to. There's things that you can find out in the collagen that you. You could never find out 20, 30 years ago. So it's. It's kind of cool. And that's very cool. I just got to wait for these other guys to come along. I talked to Max out there. He's my other son in law with Drew and married to my penultimate daughter, Jordan. And he's, he's a really good lawyer and his interest is in Nil. Have you heard of that?

[03:07:52]
No.

[03:07:52]
Nil's name, image, likeness.

[03:07:55]
Okay.

[03:07:55]
For the kids coming out of high School, college and stuff for the pro sports. And he played football for Oregon. He was a center. I watched him play in a Rose Bowl. Good guy. And we were talking a little bit about the legalities of stuff like this, and he's pretty good on contracts. And he's read this stuff and said, ah, you got him by the balls, man, because he got the receipts. I guarantee you those guys don't have the receipts. They probably trashed them years ago. I got every one of them. I got all the letters. I got the communications.

[03:08:28]
Well, John, I really hope you make some ground. I really do.

[03:08:32]
I plan.

[03:08:33]
No pun intended.

[03:08:35]
We'll tear some up.

[03:08:36]
You're tearing some ground up. I appreciate you're out there always fighting this fight and letting people know about this extraordinary discovery that you found in your place. Man, it's freaking amazing. It's always great to have you here. Let's keep doing it.

[03:08:49]
It's been a pleasure. It's always a pleasure seeing you and Jamie every year.

[03:08:52]
I hope we make a little progress next year. I hope we have something big to discuss.

[03:08:55]
Yeah, y. We hope.

[03:08:57]
I hope it cracks. I hope this motivates a lot of people, this podcast, you know, And I. I think people need to be refreshed every year to realize how to. What an extraordinary place you have and how crazy it is that there's not more work being done here.

[03:09:10]
Yeah, it. It's such a simple solution. Just do the right thing. Just do the right thing and just call me up and say, okay, come get them. I'll have tractor trailers parked out there in 24 hours. Let's load them up, boys. They're going north. Put them on the rail out in Seattle. Send them farther north. We got warehouses full of this stuff. I'm at the point now where I'm going. Maybe I should just concentrate on what we do for a living instead of the hobby, you know? I can keep digging them up, but what good is it? We're not going to study them. I want to leave that area alone. This has got good gold. I don't need to dig the gold out of there. The gold's beneath the bones, and we got to get to the gold. You got to go through the bones, and we'll get the gold someday. But we found a spot out north of town where we can't. We couldn't get drilled to bedrock. It's 450ft deep. The old timers tried to drill it, and they couldn't go deep. They couldn't get to the bottom of it. And I think that's where the freaking hot stuff hit.

[03:10:19]
Really?

[03:10:20]
25 miles north of town, I think that's where the high stuff, the hot stuff hit 450ft. You don't hit bedrock. Are you kidding? What happened there? It blew a hole in the ground. Wow. Unfortunately, I don't own that claim, but I know who does. I'm not telling them where it's at that.

[03:10:41]
Yeah.

[03:10:42]
But I have the records that show what happened there.

[03:10:45]
Well, I hope somebody does some investigations on that.

[03:10:48]
It'd be cool.

[03:10:49]
Yeah, it would be.

[03:10:50]
The answers. There's a lot of answers in these bones that we don't know what the questions are yet. So it's. It's nice that you enable me to come in.

[03:10:57]
And John, I appreciate you very much. You're the man.

[03:11:00]
You're the man.

[03:11:01]
Always great to see you.

[03:11:02]
You're the guy.

[03:11:03]
Thank you for all the stuff, too.

[03:11:04]
You bet. Thank you.

[03:11:05]
That will take a permanent spot on the desk now.

[03:11:07]
Good.

[03:11:08]
Thank you, brother.

[03:11:08]
Mammoth. Magic, dude.

[03:11:10]
Yes. I feel it. I feel magic coming off of it.

[03:11:12]
Yeah, you will. I got you some guitar picks. All right.

[03:11:15]
I'll give more to Gary. We'll do it again next year, my friend.

[03:11:18]
I'll set you up if you got any other players you want.

[03:11:20]
All right.

[03:11:20]
Thank you, sir.

[03:11:21]
Thank you. Bye, everybody.

[03:11:22]
Bye, everybody.

[00:00:12]
Alright, bro. What's happening? Good to see you.

[00:00:14]
You too.

[00:00:15]
What's going on?

[00:00:16]
You know, chill week. Yeah. Sorta.

[00:00:21]
This, recent announcement that you did about, content moderation, how has that been received?

[00:00:29]
Probably depends on who you ask.

[00:00:31]
Right. But but, you know

[00:00:32]
but, look. I mean, I've been working on this for a long time. So, I mean, you gotta do what you think is is right. You know, we we've been on a long a long journey here. Right?

[00:00:41]
I mean, it's, and I think at some level, you you start you only start 1 of these companies if you believe in giving people a voice. Right? I mean, and the whole point of social media is basically, you know, giving people the ability to share, what they want. Right. And, and, you know, it goes back to, you know, our original mission is just give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.

[00:01:10]
What do you think started the pathway towards increasing censorship? Because, clearly, we were going in that direction for the last few years. It seemed like, we really found out about it when Elon bought Twitter and we got the Twitter files. And when you came on here and when you were explaining the relationship with FBI, where they were trying to get you to take down certain things that were true and real and certain things they tried to get you to limit the exposure to them. So it's these kind of conversations.

[00:01:43]
Like, when did all that start?

[00:01:45]
Yeah. Well well, look. I I think going back to the beginning or like I was saying, I think you you start 1 of these if you care about about giving people a voice. You know, I did I wasn't too deep on our content policies for, like, the first 10 years of the company. It was just kinda well known across the company that, we were trying to give people the ability to share as much as possible.

[00:02:05]
And issues would come up, practical issues. Right? So if someone's getting bullied, for example, we deal with that, or we put in place systems to to fight bullying. Right. You know, if someone is saying, hey.

[00:02:16]
You know, someone's pirating copyrighted content on on the service. Like, okay. We'll build controls to make it so we'll find IP protected content. But it was really in the last 10 years that people started pushing for, like, ideological based censorship. And I think it was 2 main events that really triggered this.

[00:02:38]
In 2016, there was the election of president Trump, also coincided with, basically, Brexit in the EU and and sort of the fragmentation of the EU. And then, you know, in 2020, there was COVID. And I I think that those were basically these 2 events where, for the first time, we just placed we just faced this mbuttive, mbuttive institutional pressure to, to basically start censoring content on ideological grounds.

[00:03:12]
And when I'm sorry to interrupt you. But when it first came up in 2016, did it come under the guise of the Russian collusion hoax?

[00:03:20]
Yeah. And this is the thing. I at the time, I was really sort of ill prepared to to kind of parse what was going on. Right? It's, you know, I I think part of my reflection looking back on this is I I kind of think in 2016 in the aftermath, I gave too much deference to, a lot of folks in the media who are basically saying, okay.

[00:03:46]
There's no way that this guy could have gotten elected except for misinformation. People can't actually believe this stuff. Right? It has to be that there's this kind of, like, mbuttive misinformation out there. Some of it started with the the Russia collusion stuff, but it kinda morphed into different things over time.

[00:04:03]
Well, it was it was he was so ideologically polarizing. Right? Like, people didn't wanna believe that anybody looked at him and said, this should be our president.

[00:04:12]
Yeah. So so I took this and and just kind of buttumed that everyone was acting in good faith. And I said, okay. Well, there's, like there are concerns about misinformation. We should just like when people raised other concerns in the past and we try to deal with them Okay.

[00:04:28]
Yeah. People peep no. You know, if you ask people, no 1 says that they want misinformation. So maybe there's something that we should do to to basically try to address this. But I was really worried from the beginning about basically becoming this sort of decider of what is true in the world.

[00:04:47]
Right? That's, like, kind of a crazy position to be in for billions of people using your service. And, so we tried to put in place a sir a, you know, a system that would deal with it. You know, and early on, tried to basically make it so that, it was really limited. We're like, alright.

[00:05:04]
We're just gonna have this system where there's these third party fact checkers, and they can check the worst of the worst stuff. Right? So, things that are very clear hoaxes that there's, like it's not like like we're not parsing speech about whether something is slightly true or slightly false, like earth is flat, you know, things like that. Right? So so that was sort of the original intent.

[00:05:25]
We put in place the system, and it just sort of veered from there. I I think to some degree, it's because some of the people whose job is to do fact checking, a lot of their industry is focused on political fact checking. So they're just kind of veered in that direction. And we kept on trying to to basically get it to to be what we had originally intended, which is just you know, it's not the point isn't to, like, judge people's opinions. It's to to provide in this layer to to to kind of help fact check some of the stuff that seems the most extreme.

[00:05:54]
But, it just you know, it was it was just never accepted by by people broadly. I think people just felt like the fact checkers were too biased. Mhmm. Not necessarily even so much in what they ruled. Although, sometimes, I think people would disagree with that.

[00:06:10]
A lot of the time, it was just what types of things they chose to even go and fact check-in the first in the first place. So I I kind of think, like, after having gone through that whole exercise, it I don't know. It's something out of, like, you know, 1984, 1 of these books where it's just like it really is a slippery slope. And Yeah. It just got to a point where it's just, okay.

[00:06:32]
This is destroying so much trust, especially in the United States to have this program. And I guess it was probably about a few years that I really started coming to the conclusion that we were gonna need to to change something about that. COVID was the other big 1 where that was that was also very tricky because, you know, in the beginning, it was, you know, it it's like a legitimate public health crisis, you know, in the in the beginning. And it's, you know, even people who are, like, the most ardent first amendment, you know, defenders the the the Supreme Court has this clear precedent. It's like, alright.

[00:07:15]
You you can't yell fire in a crowded theater. There are times when if there's an emergency, your your ability to speak can temporarily be curtailed in order to get an emergency under control. So I was sympathetic to that at the beginning of COVID. It seemed like, okay. You have this virus.

[00:07:32]
Seems like it's killing a lot of people. I don't know like, we didn't know at the time how dangerous it was gonna be. So at the beginning, it kind of seemed like, okay. We should give a little bit of deference to the government and the health authorities on how we should play this. But when it went from, you know, 2 weeks to flatten the curve to, you know and, like, in the beginning, it was like, okay.

[00:07:54]
There aren't enough masks. Masks aren't that important. To then, it's like, oh, no. You have to wear a mask. And, you know, the like, everything was shifting around.

[00:08:01]
I it's become very difficult to kinda follow. And and this really hit the most extreme, I'd say, during it was during the Biden administration when they were trying to roll out, the vaccine program. And now I'm generally, like, pretty pro rolling out vaccines. I think on balance, the vaccines are more positive than negative. But I think that while they're trying to push that program, they also tried to censor anyone who is basically arguing against it.

[00:08:34]
And they pushed us super hard, to take down the things that were honestly were true. Right? I mean, they they basically pushed us and and said, you know, anything that, says that vaccines might have side effects, you basically need to take down. And I was just like, we're not gonna do that. Like, we're we're clearly not gonna do that.

[00:08:57]
I mean, that that that that is kind of inarguably true.

[00:09:01]
They? Who's telling you to take down things that Yeah. It was it was talk about vaccine side effects.

[00:09:06]
It was people in the, in the Biden administration. I think it was, you know, I wasn't involved in those conversations directly, but I think it was

[00:09:12]
How difficult is that to not be involved in those conversations directly? Fitness isn't just about what you do in the gym. It's also about your nutrition. But even with the best diet, some nutrients can be hard to get, and a g 1 can help fill those gaps. A g 1 delivers optimal amounts of nutrients in forms that help your body perform.

[00:09:30]
A g 1 makes foundational nutrition easy because there aren't a 1000000 different pills and capsules you have to keep track of. It's just 1 scoop mixed in water. It's such an easy routine to keep in the mornings. Ingredients in AG 1 are selected for absorption, nutrient density, and potency, and are intentionally picked to work in sync with the whole formula for optimal impact. They're seriously committed to quality.

[00:09:53]
AG 1 is tested for 100 of contaminants and impurities, and they're constantly reformulating their recipe to dial it in. This is all part of why I've partnered with AG 1 for years. To get started with AG 1 this holiday season and get a free bottle of vitamin d 3, k 2, and 5 free AG 1 travel packs with your first purchase at drinkagone.com/jorogan. That's a $76 value gift for free if you go to drink agone.com/jorogan. Seriously, get on this.

[00:10:27]
That's gotta be strange too. Right? Because you're running the company, but there's clearly, you're moderating at scale that's beyond the imagination. The number of human beings you're moderating is freaking insane. Like, what is well, what's a Facebook what how many people use it on a daily basis?

[00:10:44]
Forget about how many overall. Like, how many people use it regularly?

[00:10:47]
It's, 3,200,000,000 people use 1 of our services every day. That's it. Yeah. It's no. It's wild.

[00:10:53]
More than a third of the planet. Yeah. It's so crazy.

[00:10:56]
And it's and it's, It's

[00:10:57]
almost half of Earth.

[00:10:58]
Well, on a monthly basis, it is. Probably half.

[00:11:00]
Ugh. But, just I wanna I wanna say that though for there's a lot of, like, hypercritical people that are conspiracy theorists and think that everybody is a part of some cabal to control them. I want you to understand that whether it's YouTube or all these whatever place that you think is doing something that's awful, it's good that you speak because this is how things get changed and this is how people find out that people are upset about content moderation and and censorship. But moderating at scale is insane. Yeah.

[00:11:30]
It's insane. Yeah. That what we were talking the other day about the number of videos that go up every hour on YouTube, and it's bananas. It's bananas. That's, like, to try to get a human being that is reasonable, logic logical, and objective that's gonna analyze every video, it's virtually impossible.

[00:11:50]
It's not possible. So you gotta use a bunch of tools. You gotta get a bunch of things wrong. Yeah. And you have also people reporting things.

[00:11:55]
And how how much is that gonna affect things? There's you could have mbutt reporting because you have bad actors. You have some corporation that decides we're gonna attack this video because it's bad for us to get it taken down. Mhmm. There's so much going on.

[00:12:07]
Just I wanna put that in people's heads before we go on. Like, understand the kind of numbers that we're talking about here. Now understand you have the the pandemic, and then you have the administration that's doing something where I think they crossed the line, where it gets really weird, where they're saying what you were saying. They were trying you to get you to take down vaccine side effects, which is just crazy.

[00:12:33]
Yeah. So, I mean, it like you're saying, I mean, it this is it's so complicated, this system, that I could spend every minute of all of my time doing this and not actually focused on building any of the things that we're trying to do. AI, glbuttes, like, the future of social media, all that stuff. So, so when I I get involved in this stuff, but in general, we we have a policy team. There are people who I trust.

[00:12:56]
They're the people are kind of working on this on a day to day basis. And the interactions that, that I was just referring to I mean, a lot of this is documented. I mean, because, you know, Jim Jordan and the the house had this whole investigation and committee into into the the kind of government censorship around stuff like this. And we produced all these documents, and it's all in the public domain. I mean, basically, these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and, like, scream at them and curse.

[00:13:24]
And it's like these documents are it's all kind of out there.

[00:13:27]
Oh, did you record any of those phone calls?

[00:13:29]
I don't no. I don't think I don't think we were but but I think I

[00:13:32]
wanna listen.

[00:13:33]
I mean, there are emails. The the the emails are published. It's all it's all kind of out there. And, and they're like and, basically, it just got to this point where we were like, no. We're we're not gonna we're not gonna take down things that are true.

[00:13:46]
That's ridiculous. They want us to take down this meme of Leonardo DiCaprio looking at a TV talking about how 10 years from now or something, you know, you're gonna see an ad that says, okay. If you took a COVID vaccine, you're, eligible. You know you know, like, for for this kind of payment, like, some this sort of, like, clbutt action lawsuit type meme. And they're like, no.

[00:14:07]
You have to take that down. And we said, no. We're not we're not gonna take take down humor and satire. We're not gonna take down things that are that are true. And then at some point, I guess, I don't know, flipped a bit.

[00:14:21]
I mean, Biden, when he was he gave some statement at some point. I don't know if it's a press conference or to some journalist where he basically was like, these guys are killing people. And and, and I don't know. Then, like, all these different agencies and branches of government basically just, like, started investigating coming after our company. It was it was brutal.

[00:14:41]
It was brutal.

[00:14:42]
Wow. Yeah. It's just a mbuttive overstepping.

[00:14:49]
Yeah. And what what am I thinking

[00:14:50]
of You weren't killing people. This is this is the thing about all of this. It's like they suppressed so much information about things that people should be doing regardless of whether or not you believe in the vaccine. Regardless, put that aside. Metabolic health is of the utmost importance in your everyday life, whether there's a pandemic or there's not.

[00:15:11]
And there's a lot of things that you can do that can help you recover from illness. It prevents illnesses. It makes your body more robust and healthy. It strengthens your immune system, and they were suppressing all that information. And that's just crazy.

[00:15:25]
You can't say you're 1 of the good guys. If you're suppressing information that would help people recover from all kinds of diseases, not just COVID, the flu, common cold, all sorts of different things, high doses of vitamin c, d 3 with k 2 and magnesium. They were suppressing this stuff because they didn't want people to think that you could get away with not taking a vaccine, which is really crazy when you're talking about something that 99.07% of people survive. This is a crazy overstep, but scared the shoot out of a lot of people to red pill as it were a lot of people. Because they realized like, oh, 1984 is like an instruction manual.

[00:16:08]
Like, it's like Yeah. This is it shows you how things can go that way with wrong speak and with bizarre distortion of facts. And when it comes down to it, in today's day and age, the way people get information is through your platform, through x. This is how people are getting information. They're getting information from YouTube.

[00:16:27]
They're getting information from a a bunch of different sources now, And you can't censor that if it's real legitimate information because it's not ideologically convenient for you.

[00:16:38]
Yeah. So, I mean, that's basically the journey that I've been on. Right? Started off very pro free free speech, free expression. You know, and then over the last 10 years, there have been these 2 big episodes.

[00:16:50]
It was the Trump election and the aftermath, where I feel like in retrospect, I deferred too much to the kind of critique of the media on what we should do. Mhmm. And since then, I think, generally, trust in media has fallen off a cliff. Right? So I I don't think I'm alone in that journey.

[00:17:04]
I think No. You know, that's basically the the the experience that that a lot of people have had is, okay, it's the the stuff that's being written about is not kind of all accurate. And and even if the facts are right, it's kind of written from a slant a lot of the time. Of course. And then, and then there was the government version of it, which is during COVID, which is okay.

[00:17:23]
Like, it's like our government is is telling us that we need to censor true things. It's like, this is a disaster. And it's, you know, it's not just the US. Right? I think, you know, a lot of people in the US focus on this as an American phenomenon.

[00:17:38]
But I kind of think that the reaction to COVID probably caused a breakdown in trust in a lot of, governments around the world. Because, I mean, you know, 2024 was a big election year around the world. And, you know, there are all these countries, India, actually, you know, just like a a ton of countries that had that had elections. And the incumbents basically lost every single 1. So there is some sort of a global phenomenon where the the, whether it was because of inflation, because of the the economic policies to deal with, with COVID, or or just how how the governments dealt with COVID, seems to have had this effect that's global.

[00:18:23]
Not just the US, but, like, a very broad decrease in trust, at least in in that set of incumbents and maybe in in sort of these democratic institutions overall. So I I think that what you're saying of, yeah, how do people get their information now? It's by sharing it online on social media. I think that that's just increasingly true. And my view at this point is, like, alright.

[00:18:44]
Like, we start off focused on free expression. We kind of had this pressure tested over the last period. I I feel like I just have a much greater command now of what I think the policy should be, and, like, this is how it's gonna be going forward. And, and so, I'm I mean, at this point, I think, yeah, I think a lot of people look at this as, like, a purely political thing. You know, it's because they they kinda look at the timing, and they're like, hey.

[00:19:07]
Well, you're you're doing this right after the election. It's like, okay. I try not to, like, change our content rules, like, right in the middle of an election either. Right? It's like there's not, like, a great time to do this.

[00:19:15]
It's Right.

[00:19:16]
You know? And you wanna do it a year later.

[00:19:18]
Yeah. It's like there's no good time to do it. There's you know? And and whatever time is is going on, there's gonna be you know? So, the good thing about doing it after the election is you get to take this kind of cultural pulse as like, okay.

[00:19:29]
Where are people right now, and and how are people thinking about it? We try to have policies that reflect, you know, mainstream discourse. But yeah. I mean, I I don't know. This is something I've been thinking about for a while.

[00:19:41]
I think that this is gonna be pretty durable because at this point, we've just been pressure tested on this stuff for, like, the last 8 to 10 years with, like, these huge institutions just pressuring us. And, and I I I feel like this is kind of the right place to be going forward.

[00:19:58]
What was it like when they were attacking you? Like, what first of all, what was the premise? Like, what what would they what they're saying was your offense? Was it that you were allowing information that was not true, that was getting out there? I know there was also they're saying that you guys were allowing hate groups to speak.

[00:20:16]
There's a lot of this.

[00:20:17]
Yeah. I mean, the the the tough thing with politics is that there's, like well, when you say who who someone's coming after you. Are you referring to kind of the government and investigations and all that? I mean, so the the issue is that there's the there's what specific thing an agency might be looking into you for. And then there's, like, the underlying political motivation, which is, like, why do the people who are running this thing hate you?

[00:20:44]
And I know those can often be 2 very different things. So and we had organizations that were looking into us that were, like, not really involved with social media. Like, I think, like, the CFPB, like, this financial I don't even know what it stands for. It's the it's the financial organization, that Elizabeth Warren had set up.

[00:21:05]
Oh, great.

[00:21:06]
And and it's basically it's like, we're not a bank. The deep banking section. Yeah. No. So so, like, we're we're not a bank.

[00:21:13]
Right? It's like like, what what does Meta have to do with this? But they kind of found some theory that they wanted to investigate, and it's like, okay. Clearly, they were trying really hard, right, to to, like, find find some theory, but it, like I don't know. It just it kind of like, throughout the the the the the party and the government, there's just sort of I don't know if it's I don't know how this stuff works.

[00:21:34]
I mean, I've never been in government. I don't know if it's, like, a directive or it's just, like, a quiet consensus that, like, we don't like these guys. They're not doing what we want. We're gonna punish them. But, but it's, it's, it's tough to be at the other end of that.

[00:21:48]
What was it like? Well, it's not good. I think well, the the the thing that I think is actually the the toughest, though, is, it's it's global. Right? So and and, really, when you think about it, the US government should be defending its companies.

[00:22:04]
Right, not be the tip of the spear attacking its companies. So when we so we we talk about a lot, okay, what is the experience of, okay, if the US government comes after you. I I think the real issue is that when the US government does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world. Right? I mean, the the EU I I pulled these numbers.

[00:22:25]
The EU has fined the tech companies more than $30,000,000,000 over the last, I think it was, like, 10 or 20 years. Holy shoot. So when you when you think about it, like, okay, there's it's, like, you know, $100,000,000 here, a couple $1,000,000,000 there. But what what it, I think, really adds up to is this is sort of like a kind of EU wide policy for how they wanna deal with American tech. It's almost like a tariff.

[00:22:51]
And I think the US government basically gets to decide how are they gonna deal with that. Right? Because if the if the US government if if, if some other, you know, country was screwing with another industry that we cared about, the US government would probably find some way to put pressure on them. But I think what happened here is actually the complete opposite. The US government led the the kind of attack against the companies, which then just made it so, like, the EU is basically and all these other places are just free to just go to town on all the American companies and do whatever you want.

[00:23:20]
But, I mean, look, obviously, like, I don't wanna come across as if, like, we don't have things that we need to do better. Obviously, we we do. And when we mess something up, we deserve to be held accountable for that and and and just like everyone else. I do think that the American technology industry is a bright spot in the American economy. I think it's a strategic advantage for the United States that we have a lot of the strongest, companies in the world.

[00:23:45]
And I I think it should be part of the US' strategy going forward to defend that. And, and it's 1 of the things that I'm optimistic about with president Trump is I think he just wants America to win. And, and I think some of the stuff, like, the the other the other governments who are kinda pushing on on this stuff, it's, you know, it's like, at least the US has the rule of law. Right? So the government can come after you for something, but you still get your day in court, and the courts are pretty fair.

[00:24:12]
And, you know, so we've basically done a pretty good job of defending ourselves. And when we've when we've chosen to do that, basically, we we have a pretty good rate of winning. It's just not like that in every other country around the world. Like, if other governments decide that they're gonna go after you, you don't always get kind of a a clear shake at at kind of defending yourself on on on the rules. So I think to some degree, if the US tech industry is going to continue being really strong, I I do think that the US government has a role in, in basically defending it abroad.

[00:24:51]
And that's 1 of the things that I'm optimistic about will will happen in this administration.

[00:24:55]
Well, I think this is administration uniquely has felt the impact of not being able to have free speech. Because this was the this is the administration where Trump was famously kicked off of Twitter. That was a huge issue, like, after January 6th. Like, they removed

[00:25:14]
Mhmm.

[00:25:14]
The at the time, the sitting president. It was kind of crazy to remove that person from social media because you've decided that he incited a riot. So for him, without free speech, without people without podcasts, without social media, they probably wouldn't have had a chance because the mainstream narrative other than Fox News was so clearly against him. The majority of the television entities and print entities were against him, the majority of them. So if without social media, without podcast, the they don't stand a chance.

[00:25:51]
So they're uniquely aware of the importance of giving people their voice, free speech. But you do have to be careful about misinformation, and you do have to be careful about just outright lies and propaganda complaints or propaganda campaigns rather. And how do you differentiate?

[00:26:10]
Well, I I think that there are a couple of different things here. 1 is this is something where I think X and Twitter just did it better than us on on fact checking. We took the critique around fact checking. Sorry, around misinformation. We put in place this fact checking program, which basically empowered these third party fact checkers.

[00:26:25]
They can mark stuff false, and then we would downright it in the algorithm. I think what what Twitter and X have done with community notes, I think it's just a better program. Rather than having a small number of fact checkers, you get the whole community to weigh in. When people usually disagree on something, tend to agree on how they're voting on on a on a note, that's a good sign to the community that this is there's actually, like, a broad consensus on this, and then you show it. And you're showing more information, not less.

[00:26:52]
Right? So you're not using the fact check as a signal to show less. You're using the community note to provide real context, and and show additional information. So I think that that's better. For when you're talking about, like, nation states, or people interfering, a lot of that stuff is best rooted out at the level of kind of accounts doing phony things.

[00:27:19]
So you get, like you know, whether it's, like, China or Russia or Iran or, like, 1 of these countries, they'll set up these networks of of fake accounts and bots. And they coordinate, and they post on each other's stuff to make it seem like it's authentic and kinda convince people. It's like, wow. A bunch of people must think this or something. And the way that you identify that is you build AI systems that can basically detect that those accounts are not behaving the way that a human would.

[00:27:46]
And when we find that that there's, like, some bot that's operating, an account How

[00:27:52]
how do you differentiate? How do you figure that out?

[00:27:54]
It just I mean, there are some things that a person just would never do. Right? So, Have you met Lex Fridman?

[00:28:01]
Yes. No. Right?

[00:28:02]
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:28:03]
He might not be.

[00:28:04]
Well, but is he gonna take pbutt your turn or test? Yeah. No. He's gonna take a is he gonna make a million actions in a minute? It's like, no.

[00:28:10]
Yeah. Probably not. Okay. So it's that.

[00:28:11]
Well, I mean, it's things that aren't possible. Than that. I think, like Okay. These guys are pretty sophisticated, and it's an adversarial space. So, so we find some technique, and then they they basically kind of update their their techniques.

[00:28:25]
But but we have a team of there it's effectively, like, intelligence, counterintelligence folks, counterterrorism folks, AI folks who are building systems to identify, what are these accounts, that are just not behaving the way that people would, and how are they interacting. And and then sometimes you you you trace it down, and, and sometimes you get some tips from different intelligence, agencies. And then you can kind of piece together over time. It's like, oh, this network of people is actually some kind of fake cluster of accounts. And that's against our policies, then we just take them all off.

[00:29:01]
But But how do

[00:29:03]
you how are you sure? Like, is there a 100% certainty that there were that you are definitely getting a group of people that are bad actors? Or is it just people that have unpopular opinions?

[00:29:15]
No. I don't think it's that for this. I think,

[00:29:19]
But what I'm saying is how do you determine? Yeah. Like, how do you at what percentage of accuracy are you determining it? Do you ever accidentally think that people are gonna get moderated are actually just real people?

[00:29:34]
Yes. I think that's I think for the specific problem around these, like, large coordinated groups doing kind of, like, election interference or something. It's a large enough group. We have, like, a bunch of people analyzing it. It's like they study it for a while.

[00:29:47]
I think we're probably pretty accurate on that. But I actually think 1 of the bigger issues that we have in our moderation system is this precision issue that you're talking about. And that is actually, of all the things that we announced this week in terms of how we're gonna update the content policies, changing the content filters to have to require higher confidence and precision is actually going to be the thing that reduces the vast majority of the censorship mistakes that we make. Right? The, you know, the the removing the fact checkers and replacing them with community notes, I think it's a good step forward.

[00:30:22]
Like, a very small percent of content is fact checked in in the first place. So it's is that gonna make the hugest difference? I'm not sure. I think it'll be a positive step, though. And we we, like, opened up some content policies.

[00:30:35]
So some stuff that was restricted before we opened up. Okay. That's good. It'll mean that some set of things that might have been censored before or not. But by far, the biggest set of issues we have and and you and I have talked about a bunch of issues like this over the years is, like, it's just okay.

[00:30:51]
You have some clbuttifier that's it's trying to find, say, like, drug content. Right? People decide, okay. It's like the opioid epidemic is a big deal. We need to do a better job of cracking down on drugs and drug sales.

[00:31:01]
Right? I don't I don't want people dealing drugs on our networks. So we build a bunch of systems that basically go out and try to automate finding people who are who are dealing with who are dealing drugs. And then you basically have this question, which is how precise do you wanna set the clbuttifier? So do you wanna make it so that the system needs to be 99% sure that someone is is dealing drugs before taking them down?

[00:31:27]
Do you want it to be 90% confident, 80% confident? And then those correspond to amounts of, you know, I guess, the the statistics term would be recall. What percent of the bad stuff are you finding? So if you require 99% confidence, then maybe you only actually end up taking down 20% of the bad content. Whereas if you reduce it and you say, okay.

[00:31:51]
We're only gonna require 90% confidence. Now maybe you can take down 60% of the bad content. But let's say you say, no. We really need to find everyone who is doing this bad thing. And over it doesn't need to be as as severe as as dealing drugs.

[00:32:04]
It could just be, I mean, it could be any any kind of content of, any kind of category of harmful content. You you start getting to some of these clbuttifiers might have, you know, 80, 85 percent precision in order to get 90% of the bad stuff down. But the problem is if you're at, you know, 90% precision, that means 1 out of 10 things that the clbuttifier takes down is not actually problematic. And if you filter if you if you kinda multiply that across the billions of people who use our services every day, that is millions and millions of posts that are basically being taken down that are innocent. And and upon review, we're gonna look at and be like, this is ridiculous that this thing got taken down, which, I mean, I think you've had that experience, and we've talked about this for for a bunch of stuff over time.

[00:32:53]
And, but it really just comes down to this question of where do you wanna set the clbuttifiers. So 1 of the things that we're gonna do is basically set them to be, to be require more confidence, which is this trade off. It's going to mean that we will maybe take down a smaller amount of the harmful content, but it will also mean that we'll dramatically reduce the amount of people who whose accounts were taken off, for a mistake, which is just a terrible experience. Right? It's like, okay.

[00:33:20]
You're you're going about your day. And then 1 day, you wake up, and you're like, oh, my WhatsApp account just got, like, deactivated because it's connected to a Facebook account. And the Facebook account, is, is is is or, like, I'm I'm using on the same phone as a Facebook account where, like, we made some enforcement mistake and thought you were doing something bad that you weren't because our clbuttifiers were set to too low of precision.

[00:33:44]
Has that happened before? Oh, yeah. Where their WhatsApp app got canceled as well? Yeah.

[00:33:48]
Because, I mean, there is there a bunch

[00:33:50]
of Facebook app gets taken out. Like I say, if you have Facebook and you have, like, a sock puppet account, and the sock puppet account, you post offensive memes and you're generally gross. Yeah. If that if you get caught for that, does your WhatsApp get killed?

[00:34:04]
Not for memes, but but go back to, like, a very severe thing. Like, let's say someone is Terrorists.

[00:34:11]
Let's say the most severe. Sure.

[00:34:12]
Yeah. Let's say someone is is, like, terrorist content. They're planning some attack.

[00:34:15]
Right.

[00:34:16]
So we take down their account. Right? But then let's say that person can just go then sign up with another account. But I think, like, you know, right now

[00:34:24]
does WhatsApp get connected to that, though?

[00:34:26]
Oh, well, if it's I mean, we run these different services. And if they're on the same phone, it's basically you know, it's 1 thing that you know, it's basically regulators or governments will come to us and say, okay. It's you're you're clearly not doing enough if you kick someone off for terrorism, and then they can just, like, sign up for another account on the phone. Right. Okay.

[00:34:44]
You're also they also think, okay. Well, we're not doing enough if we deactivate their Facebook account because they're, like, planning a terrorist attack, but we let them use all our other services. Right.

[00:34:53]
Right? If you're aware. Yeah.

[00:34:54]
Yeah. So so if we if our systems think that someone is a terrorist, then you probably need to deactivate their their access to all the different accounts.

[00:35:02]
Yeah. They can't get on threads.

[00:35:04]
So it's just not threads. Instagram. Yeah. Yeah. So That makes sense.

[00:35:10]
So it's you can understand how you get there, but then you just get to this question around the precision and the confidence level. And then you're you're just making all these mistakes at scale, and it's just unacceptable. But I I think it's it's a very hard calculation of, like, where do you wanna be? Because on the 1 hand, like, I get it why people kind of come to us, and they're like, no. You need to do a better job finding more of the terrorism or the drugs and and all the stuff.

[00:35:37]
But, you know, over time, the technology will get better, and it'll get more precise. But at any given point in time, that's the choice that we have to make is do we wanna make more mistakes erring on the side of of just, like, blowing away innocent people's accounts

[00:35:51]
Right.

[00:35:51]
Or do we wanna, get a higher a somewhat higher percent of of the bad stuff off. And I think that there's some just some balance that you need to strike on this.

[00:35:58]
We were having a conversation yesterday, Mel Gibson and I, about how that can get weird. Was it Theo? Might have been Theo. I think it was Theo. Where that can get weird because I think, like, if you're a person and you work at some accounting firm, but you like posting about stuff, but you don't want it to come back and reflect on your life.

[00:36:17]
You wanna shoot post. You wanna post jokes. You wanna be silly. You should be able to be anonymous. I I think there's nothing wrong with that.

[00:36:25]
I don't think just because you state your opinion, people should be able to search where you sleep. That that doesn't make any sense to me. But if you're gonna allow anonymous accounts, you're definitely gonna open up the door to bad actors having enormous blocks of accounts where they can use either AI or just programs where they have, like, specific answers. I'm sure you've seen that before. It's it's come up on Twitter multiple times where they found hundreds of sock puppet accounts tweeting the exact same thing.

[00:36:56]
So you you've literally word for word even certain words in caps, like, either keep people are copying or pasting it or there's an email campaign that's getting legitimate people to do it or these are fake people. You're going to have if you're gonna have anonymous accounts, which I think you should, because I think whistleblower's I think the the benefits of anonymous reporting on important things that the general public needs to know about, especially whistleblower type stuff, you have to have some ability to be anonymous. But you are all if you're gonna do that, you're also gonna have the possibility that these aren't real people, that these are paid actors, these are paid people or not people at all or they're running programs and they're doing this to try to sway public opinion about very important issues. Yeah.

[00:37:43]
A lot of what we've seen too I mean, there's the anonymous accounts. Also, just over time, I think a lot of the kinda more interesting conversations have shifted from the public sphere to more private ones. So WhatsApp groups.

[00:37:56]
Mhmm.

[00:37:56]
Private groups on on Facebook. I'm sure you have this experience where, like, maybe 10 years ago, you would have posted your kind of quick takes on on whatever social media you're using. Now, you know, the stuff that I post on on Facebook and Instagram, it's like I put time into into making sure that that's kind of good content that that I wanna be seen broadly. Yeah. And then, like, most of the jokes that I make are, like, with my friends in WhatsApp.

[00:38:19]
Exactly. Yeah. So, yeah, I I think that that's sort of that's kind of where the world is more broadly now.

[00:38:25]
Yeah. Yeah. No. I think so for jokes, for that kind of stuff, with for comedians, for sure. Because also, we'll say things that we don't really mean.

[00:38:34]
We just say it because it's a funny thing to say.

[00:38:36]
I think everyone does. For sure.

[00:38:38]
Yeah. Which is just a weird thing about taking things out of context, particularly on social media where people love to do that. But there is this problem of, like, let's just say that you're a country that's involved in some sort of an international conflict and you have this ability to get out this fake narrative and just spread it widely about all sorts of things you're accusing this other government of, all sorts of things that aren't true.

[00:39:07]
Yeah.

[00:39:07]
And it just muddies the water of reality for a lot of people.

[00:39:11]
Yeah. And that's why that side of things, the kind of governments running these broad manipulation campaigns, I mean, we're not letting off the gas on that at all. I think ever like, most most categories of bad stuff that we're policing, everyone agrees are is bad. Right? No one's sitting there defending that terrorism is good, right, or child exploitation or drugs or IP violations or people inciting violence or it's like most of the stuff is bad.

[00:39:38]
People clearly believe that, that, you know, election interference and foreign government manipulation of content is bad. So we we have this is the type of stuff that the vast majority of our energy goes towards that, and we're not changing our approach on any of that. The 2 categories that I think have been very politicized are misinformation, because who gets to judge or what's false and what's true. You may just not like my opinion on something, and then, you know, people think it's false. But it but it's, but I think that that one's really tricky.

[00:40:10]
And the other 1 is, is basically what, you know, what people refer to as hate speech, which is, I think, also comes from a good place of, you know, wanting to crack down on that of, of wanting to promote more inclusion and and and belonging and people feeling, feeling good and, like, having a a pluralistic society that can, that can basically have all these different communities coexist. Except everyone. Yeah. But I think the problem is is that, you know, you just all these things are on a spectrum, and when you go too far on them, you know, I think on on that side, we just basically got to this point where there were these things that you just, like, couldn't say which were mainstream discourse. Right?

[00:40:53]
So, you know, it's like Pete Hegseth is going to, you know, probably be defending his nomination for secretary of defense on on the, senate floor. And I think 1 of the points that he's made is that he thinks that women shouldn't be able to be in certain combat roles. And until we updated our policies, that wouldn't have been a thing that you could have said on our platforms because it would call for the exclusion of a protected category of people. And so and it's like, okay. Like, on its on its face, yeah, calling for the exclusion of a protected category, that seems that, like, that's okay.

[00:41:25]
There's, like, legal protections. There's all the stuff. But, okay, if it's, like, okay to say on the floor of congress, you should probably be able to debate it on social media. Yeah. So, so I think some of the stuff, I think, well intentioned, went too far, needs to just get rationalized a bit.

[00:41:42]
But but it's those 2 categories. Misinformation and hate speech, I think, are the ones that got politicized. All the other ones, which is the vast majority of of the stuff that we do, is, I think people generally agree that it's that it's good and we need to go after it. But then you just get into this problem of the mistakes like you're talking about. Okay.

[00:42:00]
Well, what confidence level do do people want us to have, in in our enforcement? And at what point would people rather us kind of say, okay. I'm not sure that that's, that that 1 is causing an issue. So do you so on balance, maybe we should just, you know, leave that person's account up because the pain of just nuking someone's account when you're not sure or you make a mistake is, like, that's pretty real too.

[00:42:22]
Right. Yeah. Very, very complicated. Yeah. It's it's all very nuanced.

[00:42:28]
And, you know, you made a point earlier about the the government supporting its companies, that it would be a good thing for the government to support its companies. It makes sense. It's an American company. I think the issue that we're dealing with is companies, as we're describing them, have never existed before. Right?

[00:42:48]
There's never been a thing like Facebook before. There's never been a thing like Twitter before or x. It's never been a thing like Instagram. These are new things in terms of the impact that it has on society, on opinions, on conversations, on distribution of information. There's never been a thing like this that the government didn't control.

[00:43:09]
So it makes sense from their perspective continuing the patterns of behavior that they've always exhibited, which is to have control over the media. I mean, there has been CIA operatives that have been in major newspapers forever. There's always been that. There's always been this sort of input that the government had in mainstream media narratives. They are in a position now where they're losing that.

[00:43:34]
There's they've essentially lost it. And especially with this last, the push during COVID deteriorated as you were saying before the opinion and the respect that people have for the facts that are coming from mainstream journalism in a way that I've never seen before in my life, where an an enormous percentage of the population does not trust mainstream media anymore. So, well, what do they trust? They trust social media. Well, who's running that?

[00:43:58]
Well, there are a bunch of people who figured it out and invented it. Well, then freak that. Like, we gotta crack down on that. Like, we've gotta get our hands on this, which is what we saw during COVID, which is we saw during the Biden administration's attempt to remove the Hunter Biden laptop story from Twitter and from all these different things that we saw happen, the way they contacted you guys, what they're trying to do with getting you to remove real information about vaccine side effects like that. This is, like, this new attempt to crack down on this new thing, which is a distribution outlet that's far more successful than anything they've ever controlled before, and they have no control of it.

[00:44:38]
Right? They they had CBS. They had NBC. They had when they had the New York Times and all these Washington Post, when they were in control of narratives in that way, it was so much easier. There there wasn't some sort of pirate radio voice that came on and said, hey, guys.

[00:44:54]
Look, here's the the latest studies that shows this is not true. Here's why they're lying about that. Here's why they're lying about this. And now that's what you get all day long on x. It's all day long.

[00:45:05]
It's like dissolving illusions. Mhmm. And that's a completely new thing that probably led to Trump getting elected.

[00:45:15]
Yeah. I mean, the causality there is tricky. But, because there's a lot of things. I mean, there's a lot of things. But without

[00:45:21]
it, he probably doesn't get elected.

[00:45:25]
It's yeah. It's tough to know. I mean, I I do come back to this point that there were every major incumbent lost their elections around the world.

[00:45:33]
But I think that's also But

[00:45:34]
it might it might it might it might be it might be because of that revealing how how kind of incorrect and and dishonest I think some of these governments were. Yes. Yeah. So I know that's that's quite possible. And, I mean, I I do think that there is this cycle that goes on where, you know, within a society, it's not just the government that has power.

[00:45:55]
There's, like, certain people who are in these, like, culturally elite positions. And, you know, journalists, TV news anchors, like, who are the people who people broadly trust. Right? They're they're not all in government. They're, like, a lot a lot of people, in other positions.

[00:46:10]
It's like, who are the people that that, basically people look to? And, I think that's basically it needs to shift for the Internet age. And I think a lot of the people who, you know, people look to before, they're kinda realizing, hey. They weren't super honest about a lot of these issues that we that we face. And I know that's partially why, you know, social media isn't a monolithic thing.

[00:46:35]
It's not that people trust Facebook or x. They trust the creators and the voices that that they feel like are being authentic and giving them valuable information on there. So there's, I think, gonna be just this whole new clbutt of creators who basically become the new kind of cultural elites that people look at and are, like, okay. These are the people who give it to me straight. And I think that that's that's a thing that is maybe it's it's possible because of social media.

[00:47:05]
I I think it's also just the Internet more broadly. I mean, I think podcasting is obviously a huge and important part of that too. I mean, I don't I don't know to what extent you feel like you kind of got to be large, like, because of social media or just it's or just the podcasting platforms that you used. But, but I know that this is, like, a very big sea change in terms of, like, who are the voices that matter. And, you know, what we do is we we try to build a platform that gives people a voice.

[00:47:31]
But I know there's this wholesale generational shift in who are the people who are being listened to. And I think that that's, like, a very fascinating thing that is going on, because I I I think that that's, like, what is what's going on here. It's not it's it's not just the government, and people saying, hey. We we want, like, a very big change here. I think it's just like a wholesale shift in saying, we just want different people who we actually trust

[00:47:57]
Right.

[00:47:57]
Who who are actually gonna, like, tell us the truth and, like, and not give us, like, the bullshoot opinions that you're supposed to say, but, like, the type of stuff that I would actually, like, when I'm sitting with my in my living room with my friends, like, the stuff that we know is true. Like, who are the people who kind of have the courage to actually just say that stuff? I don't know. I I think that whole, like, cultural elite clbutt needs to get repopulated with people who people actually trust.

[00:48:21]
Yeah. The problem is these people that are starting these jobs, they're coming out of universities. And and the universities are indoctrinated into these ideas as well. It's it's very difficult to be a person who stands outside of that and takes unpopular positions. You get socially ostracized and people are very they're very hesitant to do that, and they would rather just keep their mouth shut and talk about it in quiet conversation.

[00:48:47]
And that's what we experience, which is another another argument for anonymous accounts. I think you should have anonymous accounts with I think you should be able like, if there's something like COVID mandates or some things that you're dealing with and you don't wanna get fired because of it, you should be able to talk about it.

[00:49:03]
Mhmm. And you

[00:49:03]
should be able to post facts and information and what you've learned. And, you know, anecdotal experiences of people in your family that had vaccine side effects and not worry about losing your job, which people were worried about, which is so crazy. And, you know, and you're seeing a lot of the people that used to be in mainstream media got fired, and now they're trying to do the sort of podcast thing. But they're trying to do it like a mainstream media person. So they're like gaslighting during podcasts, and people are like, hey, freakface.

[00:49:35]
Like, this you you can't do that here. It doesn't work.

[00:49:39]
Yeah. It's a well, it's a new medium. I mean, I I know I'm sure you know the history on this. It's like when when people transition from radio to TV, the initial TV anchors were the same radio people, but just, like, being filmed while speaking on the radio. But it turned out it actually was a completely different type of person that you need, because on your radio, it's just, like, your voice and your cadence and all that.

[00:49:59]
It's like, you know, the the whole phrase. It's like you've got a good radio voice. Right? It's like Yeah. Okay.

[00:50:04]
On TV, you need to be telegenic. Right? You need to kind of has have charisma in that medium. It's, like, a completely different thing. And, I think that that's gonna be true for the Internet too.

[00:50:15]
It's, you know, it's not as cut. Or I think part of it is the format. Right? The fact that you do these, like, 2, 3 hour episodes I mean, I hated doing TV because, you know, I basically got started I started Facebook when I was 19, and I was good at some things, very bad at others. I was good at coding and, like, real bad at at kind of, like, talking to people and explaining what I was doing.

[00:50:40]
And I just, like, had these experiences early on where I'd go on TV, and, like, it wouldn't go well. And they'd, like, cut to they'd cut it to some down to some random sound bite, and I'd, like, look stupid. And then, like, and then, basically, like, I'd get super nervous about about, like, going on TV because I knew that they were just gonna cut it in some way that I was gonna look like a freaking idiot. And, like and so I'm just like, this sucks. Right?

[00:51:06]
So so I just like it's it's kind of a funny thing about, like it was, like, in some ways, it's like, okay. At the same time, I was, you know, gaining confidence, being able to, like, build more and more complicated products. And it's even as an early twenties person, I was like, I could do this. And then on the kind of TV and comms public side, I was like, this is a disaster. Every time I go out, it's worse and worse and worse, and it just gets so but but, I mean, it's it's 1 of the reasons why I think on the Internet, like, there's no reason to cut it to a 4 minute sound bite conversation.

[00:51:38]
It's like I think part of what what makes it authentic is, like, we can just I mean, these are complex issues. We can unpack it for hours and and probably still have hours more stuff to talk about. It just it's I I don't know. I I think it's just more real.

[00:51:51]
Yeah. It's definitely that. And the the other thing about television that's always gonna hold it back is the fact that every conversation gets interrupted every x amount of minutes because you have to cut to a commercial. So you you really can't get into depth. Even Bill Maher shows only an hour.

[00:52:08]
You know, you have all these people talking over each other, then you sit down with 1 person for a short amount of time. It's just not enough time for important subjects. It's also a lot of them, for whatever reason, wanna do in front of an audience, which is the worst way to get people to talk. Mhmm. Like, when you imagine these disasters that you had, if there was, like, 5,000 people staring at you in a TV crowd as

[00:52:28]
well. Yeah.

[00:52:29]
So there's that added element Yeah. Which is so not normal and not conducive to having a conversation where you're talking about nuanced things Yeah. Where you have to, like, think. You have to be able to pause and and not concern yourself being entertaining for these freaking people just sitting there staring at you.

[00:52:47]
Yeah. And and, also, like, when you're having a conversation, say it, like I don't know. It's like when you start talking about something, your kind of subconscious kicks in. You start thinking about the the topic. So it's like you might not actually have the thing that you wanna say until, like, 5 minutes later.

[00:53:01]
Right. And Right. I mean, it's like, when we started this conversation, I think, like, the first few minutes were just kinda slow. It's like warming up. Like, I'm like, okay.

[00:53:07]
Kinda like downloading into my memory. Like, how how am I gonna, like you know, it's like, how am I gonna, you know, just explain these different things? But it's, yeah. No. I just think that that's sort of how people work.

[00:53:19]
Well, it's also like it's conversations are like a dance. You know. 1 person can't be dancing at another speed and the other person is going slow. Like, you kinda have to find the rhythm that you're gonna talk with and then you have to actually be interested in what you're talking about. That's another thing that they are at a huge disadvantage of in mainstream media.

[00:53:38]
It's like, they're just doing that because that's their job. You know, they probably don't even know a lot about climate change. They probably don't really understand too much about what space SpaceX is trying to accomplish, but they're just reporting on

[00:53:50]
it. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure there's the and a lot of the people I've met there, I think, are good people.

[00:53:54]
I'm sure.

[00:53:55]
It's just a tough format.

[00:53:56]
Right? It's a tough format. Yeah. And the problem is they get locked into that format, and no 1 trusts them. And then they leave, and they go, yeah.

[00:54:02]
But you were just lying to us about this, that, and the other thing. And now I'm supposed to believe you're 1 of the good guys. You're 1 of the straight shooters now. Yeah. Well, getting back to the original point, this is why I think, you know, it makes sense to me that the government didn't want you to succeed and to have the sort of unchecked power that they perceived social media to to have.

[00:54:30]
And I think 1 of the benefits that we have now of the Trump administration is that they have clearly felt the repercussions of a limited amount of free speech, of free speech limitations, censorship, government overreach. If anybody saw it look, it there's I don't know what the actual impact of the Hunter Biden laptop story would have been. I don't know. But there's many people that think it probably amounted to millions of votes overall in the country of people that were on the fence, the people that weren't sure who they're gonna vote for. If they found out the Hunter Biden laptop was real, they're like, oh, this is freaked.

[00:55:06]
Their family's freaking crazy. And they would have voted for Trump. That's possibly real. And if that's possibly real, that could be defined as election interference. And all that stuff scares the shoot out of me.

[00:55:19]
That kind of stuff scares the shoot out of me. When the government gets involved in what could be termed election interference, but through some weird loophole, it's legal. Whereas some Well, I I don't think I

[00:55:31]
don't think that the pushing for social media companies to censor stuff was legal. I mean, it's, like, that's I mean, there's all the stuff about what the like, people talk about the first amendment and okay. These these tech platforms should should offer free speech like the First Amendment. It's that, I think, is a philosophical principle. The First Amendment doesn't apply to companies and what in our content moderation.

[00:55:53]
It's more of an American ethos about how we think that that, you know, best dialog is carried out. But the first amendment does apply to the government. That's, like, the whole point. Right? It's the government is not allowed to censor this stuff.

[00:56:06]
So at some level, I do think that, you know, having people in the administration calling up the guys on our team and yelling at them and cursing and threatening repercussions if we don't take down things that are true is, like, it's pretty bad. It sounds illegal. I would love to

[00:56:25]
hear it. I wish somebody recorded those conversations. Well, I

[00:56:28]
mean because it'd be I mean, again, it's well great to listen to.

[00:56:30]
Somebody could animate them, maybe PolyTune? The animate. A a lot

[00:56:34]
of the material is is public. I mean, it's I mean, Jim Jordan led this whole investigation in the Yeah. In Congress. I mean, it was basically I think about this as, like you know, what Elon did on the Twitter files when he took over that company, I think Jim Jordan basically did that for the rest of the industry with the the congressional investigation that he did. And we just turned over, like, all of the documents and everything that we had, to them, and they basically put together this report.

[00:57:01]
And the people that actually did call for censorship,

[00:57:04]
what was the response to all this?

[00:57:08]
To what? To the to the investigation? Yes. I don't know.

[00:57:12]
I don't know. Did was anybody held accountable? Was there any I mean any repercussions?

[00:57:19]
I mean, they lost the election.

[00:57:20]
Yes. So that's it. That's I

[00:57:22]
mean, that's it. Well, in a democracy, I mean, that's kinda right? Right.

[00:57:27]
But if the if what they did was illegal, do you not think that some steps should be put in place to make sure that people are punished for that and that that never happens again? It seems that that has an a mbuttive impact on the way our country goes. If that's election interference, and I think it is, that has a mbuttive impact on the direction of our country.

[00:57:51]
Yeah. Well, the COVID thing, I don't think, was election interference as much as it was just, like, government meddling where it shouldn't have. But yeah. No. I mean, it's No.

[00:57:59]
I'm I'm talking about the underbowed last week.

[00:58:01]
Say, you know, like, what specific retribution or justice should happen to anyone who is involved in these things. But I think your point about, let's make sure this doesn't happen again

[00:58:13]
Yeah.

[00:58:14]
Is, is the 1 that I'm more focused on. Right? Because it's the thing that I reflect on on my journey on all this, which is like, okay. Yeah. So we didn't take down the stuff that was true, but we did generally defer to the government on some of these policies that in retrospect, I probably wouldn't knowing what I know now.

[00:58:36]
And, and I I just think that that's that's sort of the journey that we've been on. It's like, k. We start the thing focused on free expression, go through some, like, pretty crazy times in the world, get it pressure tested, see where we basically ended up doing stuff that led to a slippery slope that we weren't happy with the conclusion, and, like, try to reset. And that's sort of the moment that we're at now is is trying to just rationalize, a bunch of a bunch of the policies. And and, look, I mean, obviously, crazy things can happen in the future that might unearth something that I haven't, you know, some some kind of angle on this that I haven't, thought enough about yet.

[00:59:14]
So I don't know. I'm sure I'm not done making mistakes in the world. But, but I think at this point, we have a much more thorough understanding of what the space is. And I I I think our our kind of values and principles on this are likely going to be much more durable going forward. And and I think that that's probably a good thing for the Internet.

[00:59:35]
I think it's a great thing for the Internet. I was very happy with your announcement. I'm very happy that you took those steps. I'm very happy you brought Dana White aboard.

[00:59:42]
Oh, he's awesome. Been talking to him for a while. About that. I mean, he's like talk about, like, an amazing entrepreneur. Right?

[00:59:47]
It's like, I just want like, because I control our company, I have the benefit of not having to convince the board not to fire me. Right? It's like a normal corporate environment. It's like, basically, the CEO just tries to, like you know, they're just trying to convince the board to, like, let them have their job and pay them more. It's like, alright.

[01:00:04]
The board doesn't pay me except for security, and, and I'm not worried about losing my job, because I control the majority of the voting in in the company. So I actually get to use our board to, like, have the smartest people who I can get to have around me help work on these problems. So it's like, alright. Who are the people I want? Like, I I just want, like, the best entrepreneurs and people who've created different things.

[01:00:26]
And, like, I mean, Dana is, like, this guy who I mean, he basically took the sport from being this, like I think it was viewed as, like, this pretty marginal thing when he got started. Right? I mean, John McCain was trying to outlaw it and Yeah. And, you know, now it's like and I think it and f 1 are the 2 fastest growing sports in the world. It's got 100 of millions of people viewing it.

[01:00:46]
It's like I mean, what Dana's done with the UFC is, like, 1 of the most legendary business stories, and, and the brand is beloved. And and I think he's just, so he's, like, a world clbutt entrepreneur, and he's just like a he's got a strong backbone. And I think part of what the conversation that I had with him around joining our board was, okay. Like, we have a lot of governments and folks around the world putting a lot of pressure on our company, and, like, we need some, like, strong people who are gonna basically, you know, help help advise us on how to handle some of these situations. And, and so yeah.

[01:01:26]
That's but but, yeah, I mean, this is running this company is not for the faint of heart. I mean, you definitely there's definitely a lot of pressure from from, like, all these different governments. And and then then it's like, okay. I could spend all my time doing that, but I'm not even a politician. Like, I wanna I just wanna spend my time building things.

[01:01:40]
Right? So so it's, so, yeah, I I think Dana's gonna be great.

[01:01:44]
He's the best. Great entrepreneur. I agree with everything you said about him. Without him, none of the UFC would have ever taken place the way it did. I mean, you needed the Fertitta brothers.

[01:01:51]
They had to come in with all the money and the vision. And it's really funny because Eddie Bravo and I you know, we've been fans for so long. Eddie Bravo and I went to a live event in the nineties. I was working for the UFC as a backstage interviewer, and he went there with Ricky Rocket. You know Ricky Rocket from Poison?

[01:02:08]
No. He's a freaking black belt under the Machados. He's legit. Super legit. Really nice guy too.

[01:02:15]
Anyway, so Ricky Rocket and him were at the, UFC, and we were talking about it in the nineties. So, like, you know what the sport needs? Because we were in love with it. We're like this but we were martial artists. We're like, the sport needs some billionaires who just throw a ton of money at it and just get it huge.

[01:02:32]
And then the Ferdida brothers come along. Mhmm. Billionaires with a ton of money who are huge fans of the sport. Mhmm. Just love the sport.

[01:02:41]
You know, we're hiring people like Frank Shamrock to come in and train them and work out and we're taking jiu jitsu with John Lewis and they were really getting into it. And so then they buy the UFC for, like, $2,000,000 which is probably the greatest purchase ever, except they were 40 plus $1,000,000 in the hole Mhmm. When they financed the ultimate fighter. And then that was 2,005, and then this 1 fight takes place with Stefan Bader and Forrest Griffin on television. It's so wild and so crazy that millions of people start tuning in.

[01:03:12]
The sport's born. Then you have Chuck Liddell who was the champion at the time, who was the most fan friendly champion you could ever have, just a freaking Berserker with just psychopath with a freaking head tattoo and a mohawk crushing people. In his prime. He was the perfect poster guy for the UFC because he was just smashing people and then throwing his arms back like in a cage. It was nuts.

[01:03:36]
I'm sure you've seen a lot of Chuck Waddell fights. Right? Yeah. It is it was just the the whole thing took off. But without Dana, it would have never taken place.

[01:03:44]
The guy's tireless. That man, I could call him up. I'll call him up at, like, 2 o'clock in the morning sometime. Like, there's some fight going on. And I'll say, hey, This is going on next weekend.

[01:03:53]
I'm so freaking pumped and hit we'll we'll talk for hours for hours. He just wants to talk about fights. He's, like, so locked in, like, all the time, you know? And he's he's just, like, so driven. He was and now that he's healthy, like, oh my god.

[01:04:08]
He's got what Gary Breck has done for him is incredible. He lost all his weight, got super thin, real fit, super healthy. He doesn't freak around with alcohol anymore. He just eats healthy food. He looks great.

[01:04:20]
Now he's getting even more energy. Yeah. It's incredible.

[01:04:23]
Well, we're lucky to have some of it.

[01:04:25]
Yeah. We are. And you know what? We're also lucky that you got into jujitsu because I think I think that had an effect on you. You look different.

[01:04:34]
When you walked in here today, you look thicker. You look like a different guy. You do. You look like a jujitsu guy now. It's funny.

[01:04:40]
I saw your neck. I'm like, his neck's bigger. Your neck is bigger. Good. Are you using iron neck, or is it just

[01:04:46]
I do like I do like iron neck. But but it's but when I started training not just jujitsu, but striking, I was like, alright. I wanna find a way to do this where I don't, like, like, hurt my brain. Right? It's like, alright.

[01:05:00]
Like, I need to I'm gonna be running this company for a while. I would like to

[01:05:03]
Yeah.

[01:05:03]
You know, like, stay stay healthy and not take too much damage. And so I think the number 1 thing you need to do is well, in addition to having good partners is, have a strong neck. Yes. So yeah. So yeah.

[01:05:16]
No. I I take that I take that pretty seriously.

[01:05:18]
It's very important. A strong neck is great for jiu jitsu as well because it's a weapon, like, in certain positions, like, head and arm chokes. Yeah. You need a neck.

[01:05:26]
Yeah.

[01:05:27]
Yeah. It's a weapon. Yeah. And, you know, and also for defending things and just for overall stability. But for striking, it's very like Mike Tyson in his prime.

[01:05:36]
He had

[01:05:36]
a freaking 20 inches neck. Yeah. No. It's crazy. His neck is, like, bigger than his his face.

[01:05:41]
A photo of him in a suit. It's the craziest photo. It's like his neck starts at the top of his ears and it just goes straight down

[01:05:47]
Yeah.

[01:05:48]
When he was a champ, when

[01:05:49]
he was a tank. Amazing.

[01:05:50]
Yeah. The neck's very important. But it's also, like, you know, you're doing it very smart. You're you're bringing in Dave Camarillo.

[01:05:58]
He's awesome. Amazing. He's awesome.

[01:06:00]
You're bringing in all these, like, super talented people to train with you too, which is really important and just learn systematically, probably the way you've learned all these other things, which is really so fascinating to me about MMA and and jiu jitsu in particular, is the general public has this knuckle dragging meathead sort of perspective. And then I'm like, let me introduce you to Mikey Musumeci. Yeah.

[01:06:25]
Well, there's there's a range.

[01:06:26]
There's a

[01:06:27]
range for Mikey to Right.

[01:06:28]
But Mikey is 1 of the elite of the elite, and he's about as far from that.

[01:06:32]
I love Mikey. He's he's a very good guy. He's super good guy.

[01:06:35]
He's super kind and and unbelievably brilliant and eccentric

[01:06:40]
Mhmm.

[01:06:40]
And just and just so dedicated jiu jitsu.

[01:06:42]
Right? Yeah. I'm I'm glad I'm glad that he's over at the UFC now.

[01:06:45]
Yes. I am too. Yeah. Well, I'm glad a guy like that exists. I I like because I like I'm like, okay.

[01:06:50]
I know you think that. Let me show you this guy. And then, like, let me show you what it really is. Let me introduce you to these people because they're the nicest people. I know.

[01:06:58]
There's no better stress reliever in the world than jujitsu or martial arts. There's no better. You you leave there. You're the kindest person in the world. You just, like, heal all of your aggressions out of your system.

[01:07:08]
Yeah. And it's a phenomenal stress reliever because regardless of what you're going through day to day with Facebook and Meta and all the different projects you have going on, it's not as hard as someone trying to just choke you unconscious.

[01:07:20]
It's it's not as acute. I think it's like, sometimes you have someone trying to choke you unconscious slowly over a multi month multiyear period, and that's that's business. But Right. But no. I think that sometimes in business, the cycle time is so long that it is very refreshing to just have a feedback loop that's like, oh, I, like, had my hand down, so I got punched in the face.

[01:07:42]
It's like that's like Yeah. That's, but yeah. I know. I it's it's really important to me for balance. I mean, I I basically try to train every morning.

[01:07:52]
I'm I'm either doing general fitness or or kind of MMA. I'm do sometimes grappling, sometimes striking, or sometimes both. But, it got to the point where I'm not I I tore my ACL training. I was probably, at that point, I didn't have I wasn't integrated between my weight training and my fighting training, so I think I was probably overdoing it. So now Mhmm.

[01:08:14]
Now we basically I'm I'm just trying to do this in a cohesive way, which I I think will be more sustainable. But when I when I tore my ACL, first of all, everyone at the company was like, ah, freak. We're gonna get so many more emails now. It's like that that he can't that he can't do this. And then and I sat down with Priscilla, and I expected her to be like, you're an idiot.

[01:08:35]
Like, what do you expect? You're like you know, I was in my late thirties at the time, and but she was like, no. She's like, when you heal your ACL, you better go back to fighting. And I'm like, what do what do you mean? She's like, you are so much better to be around now that you're doing this.

[01:08:49]
You have to fight. And so That's hilarious. Yeah. So, and, Isn't

[01:08:54]
it funny that, like, that's completely contrary to the way most people, if they're outside of it, would perceive it?

[01:09:01]
I mean, it it definitely takes the edge off things. But it's, like, after, like, a couple of hours of doing that in the morning, it's just, like yeah. It's, like, nothing else that day is gonna stress you out that much. Right? You can just

[01:09:12]
you can just deal with it. Voluntary adversity.

[01:09:16]
Yeah. Yeah. No. It's good. It's good.

[01:09:18]
It's also good, I think, to be a little bit tired. Like, it's like it just it's I love that feeling of just, like, you're not, like, exhausted. And sometimes you get a session and you just go so hard, and you I need to, like, just go to sleep or something. But Yeah.

[01:09:32]
It's also good to know that you can kill people. That's that's a good thing to know. It's a good thing to know if something goes sideways.

[01:09:40]
I guess there's a there's a certain conflict around that. Yeah.

[01:09:43]
It's an important skill. Yeah.

[01:09:44]
If you

[01:09:45]
could give it in a pill, if you could sell it in a pill, everybody would buy it. Yeah. A 100 no 1 would say I'd like to be the vulnerable guy walking around with a bunch of freaking buttbuttins.

[01:09:54]
Yeah.

[01:09:54]
No 1 would say that. They would say, how much is the pill? Oh, it's $2. Oh, give me 1 of those pills. You take the pill.

[01:10:00]
Everybody would take that pill. Well, it exists. It's just not a pill. It's a long journey of pain and discipline and and trial and error and learning and being open minded and being objective and understanding position, asking questions and asking questions, and having good training partners, and absorbing information, and really being diligent with your skill acquisition work, which is 1 of the most important and neglected parts of jujitsu because training is so fun. Everybody just wants to roll, you know.

[01:10:30]
Yeah. Where really the best way to do it is actually to drill and Mhmm. It's the most boring, but really you should drill constantly just jam those skills into your neurons where your brain knows exactly what to do in every position. And it's such an intellectual pursuit. And most people don't think of it that way because you have to manage your mind while you're moving your body.

[01:10:50]
You're managing anxieties. You're you're you're trying to figure out when to hit the gas and when to control position and recover. There's so much going on in training that applies to virtually any stressful thing that you'll ever experience in your life. And along with it, you get this skill where you can kill people. You shouldn't kill people.

[01:11:14]
Let me be clear. I'm not saying it's a good thing to kill people. I'm definitely not. But I'm saying it's a good thing to if someone's trying to kill you and they absolutely can't because you could kill them easy, that's way better. It's a way better situation to be in.

[01:11:28]
Yeah. No. It's it's great. I mean, it's it's open a lot of how I think about stuff. I mean, it's it is just interesting when your your point about, like, having a pill that allows you to just kind of know that you have this kind of physical ability.

[01:11:45]
It's,

[01:11:46]
It's a superpower.

[01:11:47]
It's it's interesting because I I do think a lot of our society has become very, like I don't know. I don't even know the right word for it, but it's like it kinda, like, neutered or, like, emasculated. And it's there's, like, a whole energy in this that I I think it's it is very healthy in the right balance. I mean, I think part of the reason I mean, every 1 of the things that I enjoy about it is that I feel like I can just, like, express myself. Right?

[01:12:16]
It's like when you're running a company, people typically don't wanna see you being, like, this ruthless person who's, like, just like, I'm just gonna, like, crush the people I'm competing with. But, like, but when you're fighting, it's like, no. No. That's like so I I think in some worded. I think in some ways, when people see me competing in the sport, they're like, oh, no.

[01:12:34]
That's the real mark. It's like because it's it goes back to the all the media training stuff we were talking about when I'm going and doing my sound bites for 2 minutes. It's like, no. It's like, freak that guy. It's like, that's the real 1.

[01:12:45]
It's but,

[01:12:47]
well, you definitely got a lot of respect in the martial arts community. People get super excited that you were so involved in it and so interested in it because anytime someone like yourself or like Tom Hardy or anyone they're like, wow, that guy's into it? Like, wow. Anytime something like that happens and there's, like, some new person who's a prominent person, a very smart person, it's really interested in it, we all get very excited because we're, like, oh, boy.

[01:13:08]
It's a very welcoming community. Super. I I think

[01:13:11]
there's a lot of

[01:13:12]
a lot of sports are, like, nah. We don't want you.

[01:13:14]
It's not a jock community. No. No. No. Super kind.

[01:13:17]
Yeah. Like, jujitsu people in in particular, they're some of the nicest pea and those are my friends forever. You know? They'll be my friends for life.

[01:13:24]
Yeah. Yeah. No. It's it's a it's a good crew. I mean, when I got hurt, I I really kinda missed the guys I trained with.

[01:13:30]
I mean, it's like Davis put together this this group. It's basically these, like all these young pro fighters who are kind of, like, up and coming, like, kind of early twenties, but they've only been doing it for a few years. So, like, I've been doing it for for a few years. That way, it's like we kind of are have a more similar level of skill, and they're all better than me. But, like, but in terms of I'm like I was in my late thirties, and they're in their early twenties.

[01:13:52]
It was sort of, like, they're kind of be coming into Becoming Men. I'm, like, sort of at the end of my fiscal peak, but it's, like, it's, it's, it's it's a really good crew. Yeah. No. It's a good crew.

[01:14:05]
And the competing thing is fun. I can't wait to get back to that too. I mean, it's, like, basically I mean, I was also doing it with so it's basically some a group of pro fighters and then a handful of meta executives would do it. And then, basically, we would just kinda, like, fight each other, and it would be fun. And and, and then 1 of them decided 1 day that they're they're like, you know, I think I'm getting pretty good at jiu jitsu.

[01:14:27]
I'm gonna go to a tournament. And I was like, alright. Good luck with that, bro. Like, I'm I'm not going to I'm not gonna go to tournament. It's like they gotta like, I don't wanna go to a tournament and get him get embarrbutted.

[01:14:37]
It's like like but then the guy goes to the tournament. He, like, does pretty well. I'm like, that guy? It's like it's like, okay. It's like, we go all the time and, like, and, if if he's doing well in the tournament, that's like, alright.

[01:14:49]
Fine. Sign me up. Right? It's like so, I mean, because it's just, like, super competitive. So this was, like, when was this?

[01:14:57]
It must have been I don't know. I guess I I rolled into this tournament, and I registered under my first and middle name. So people didn't know who who I was. And I had, like, sunglbuttes and a hat, and I wore a COVID mask. And, like, and I and, basically, it was like it wasn't until they called our names to step onto the mat that I was like, alright.

[01:15:19]
I took all this stuff off, and they go, like, what?

[01:15:22]
That's kind of a cheat code.

[01:15:24]
I mean

[01:15:25]
yeah. Kinda kinda freak out. I, yeah,

[01:15:27]
I think he was trying to figure out what was going on. Afterwards, his his, coach was like he was like, I think that was Mark Zuckerberg who who just submitted me. And the the coach is like, no. No no no way. Then he's like, no.

[01:15:39]
I think that was. He's like, what? You're you're fighting Mark Zuckerberg. He said, get back in there. It's like, get get go find him.

[01:15:44]
He's like, no. He just submitted me. It's

[01:15:51]
That's very funny. Yeah, man. Well, Tom Hardy's doing that too. Right? He's done multiple tournaments now.

[01:15:56]
Yeah. No. I think I think yeah. Yeah. I I I can't wait wait to get back to competing.

[01:16:05]
It's been it's been sort of a slow journey on the the rehab. It's sort of like learning twice. Mhmm. But but we're we're getting there.

[01:16:10]
How far out are you?

[01:16:11]
Oh, no. I'm done with the rehab now. Now I'm just ramping up.

[01:16:14]
Far out are you from surgery?

[01:16:18]
12, 12 months. 13 months.

[01:16:20]
So you did the patella tendon graft. Right?

[01:16:23]
I did. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:16:24]
That's a rough 1 to come back from. I did, the patella tendon graft on my left knee, and it took me about a year. I did the ACL from a cadaver. It's actually they use an Achilles tendon from a cadaver on my right knee, and I was back to jujitsu in 6 months. Like, full confidence in 6 months.

[01:16:41]
I was Interesting. 100% recovered, kicking the bag, everything. Yeah.

[01:16:46]
Yeah. How how, how old were you when you got those?

[01:16:50]
The first 1, I was 26. The second 1, I was 30 1, 32, somewhere around there.

[01:17:02]
Oh, so so young? Yeah. Because I mean, my my doctor is basically like, look, you're at the you're, like, at the boundary. You could go either way. But if you wanna compete again, then I'd recommend doing the patella.

[01:17:12]
Yeah. I know they say that. I don't agree with that. I mean, just from my own personal experience, my doctor told me that the ACL from a cadaver when they use the patella tendograft is a 150% stronger than your natural ACL. He said you'll be back to because I didn't have any meniscus damage on my right knee.

[01:17:29]
He's like you'll be back to a 100%. I have a lot of meniscus damage on my left knee unfortunately, which is also part of the problem with the recovery of that 1. But the, patella tendon graft, the bone on the kneecap was painful forever in terms of, like, getting on my knees, like, training from my knees, doing doing certain positions and even just stretching. Like, you know, putting my knees on the ground, sitting on my heels and then laying back, it was freaking painful. It took forever to break all that scar tissue up, and now it's fine.

[01:18:00]
It's fine now.

[01:18:01]
Yeah. I mean It's

[01:18:02]
a long time ago.

[01:18:03]
Yeah. I can kinda do everything that I want at this point. It's still, like, a little sore, but I I I don't know. I think that it's supposed to be a couple years until you, like, feel like it's full. I think it takes some time for the nerves to grow into it and all that.

[01:18:14]
Did you incorporate peptides in your recovery?

[01:18:17]
I I didn't.

[01:18:19]
Do you hate healing?

[01:18:20]
Do I hate healing? No.

[01:18:22]
I didn't use peptides.

[01:18:23]
I don't know. I just took my doctor's advice on it.

[01:18:25]
Yeah. But don't do that anymore.

[01:18:27]
I mean,

[01:18:28]
next time No. There's other people to talk to.

[01:18:31]
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's it's going pretty well. It's going pretty well. I'm sure

[01:18:34]
it goes pretty well, but it would go quicker with peptides. 100%.

[01:18:38]
For sure.

[01:18:38]
But it's been this interesting

[01:18:40]
opportunity to, like, like, I really don't want that to happen again. So I I feel like I'm so much more focused on technique. Like, the first time that I learned all this stuff, I was like, I was probably, like, a little too brutish about it and and just, like, muscling through stuff. And now, I don't know. Now I feel like I'm, like, really learning how to do this stuff correctly, and I can do it way more effortlessly.

[01:19:05]
So it's it's,

[01:19:06]
That's the goal. How did it pop? How did it pop?

[01:19:09]
I was I was, like, the end of a session, and, through 2 hours into training, and I was doing, like, a few rounds. And, and I basically, I threw a leg kick, and the other guy went to check it. And I, like, leaned back to try to get around the check and just put too much torque on my knee. Mhmm. So it was the planted leg.

[01:19:27]
But, Mine was a planted leg too. Yeah. But it's I don't know. Dave was, like, you know before that round, Dave was like, you're done. I'm like, no.

[01:19:35]
1 more round.

[01:19:36]
You know? So you're too tired as well.

[01:19:38]
Yeah. And and I'd and I and I basically and I hadn't, you know, I I basically had also just done a really hard kind of, like, leg workout the day before.

[01:19:50]
But I don't

[01:19:51]
think the the but the fight guys didn't know that. So I I I really just pushed it too hard.

[01:19:55]
Are you aware of, knees over toes guy? Yeah. Have you done his stuff?

[01:20:00]
I've I've looked at it a bunch. I mean, the rehab thing I took really seriously, I thought that was pretty interesting too. Mhmm. That's, I don't wanna, like, have to do a lot of rehabs like this 1. But to do 1 of them, I actually thought it was a pretty interesting experience because it's, like, week over week, you're just getting back so much mobility and Mhmm.

[01:20:17]
And ability to do stuff. And Yeah. No. I feel like I'm, I don't know. At this point, I just, like like, probably half my weight training is is effectively kind of, like, rehab and joint health stuff.

[01:20:32]
And, like, wrists, shoulders, knee, all that in addition to the big muscle groups.

[01:20:37]
Yeah. That's very smart. The knee over toes guy stuff is particularly effective because it it all comes from a guy that had a series of pretty catastrophic knee injuries and was plagued with weak knees his whole life. And then developed a bunch of different methods to strengthen all the supporting muscles around the knee that are really extraordinary. Everything from Nordic curls.

[01:21:00]
Do you do those? Do you do Nordic curls?

[01:21:03]
I should. I should do more than I do.

[01:21:05]
Yeah. Leg curls, Nordic curls, but Nordic curls in particular because, you know, you it's very difficult to do.

[01:21:10]
You you got your

[01:21:11]
body Yeah. You lift your whole body up with your hamstrings. Yeah. And all these different, slant board squats and different lunges and split squats and all these different things which, like, really strengthen up all the supporting muscles around the knee better than anything that I've ever tried before. And he's got, like, a whole program where it scales up and he puts it online for everybody.

[01:21:34]
Yeah. And he gives away a lot of information for free because he said, look, look, when I was 11 years old, I wish I had access to this. So I'm gonna put it out there for everybody. Great guy. Mhmm.

[01:21:43]
Yeah. Cool. But I can't recommend that stuff enough. But I think what you're doing is like strengthening shoulders, strengthening that's really the way to do it. Like, you have to think of muscles in terms of like armor, you know.

[01:21:54]
If you wanna do this thing, you know, it's better to have good bumpers around your car if you might bump into other cars. Mhmm.

[01:21:59]
You know,

[01:21:59]
you don't wanna just have raw sheet metal, you know?

[01:22:03]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and I think a lot of people just focus on, like, the big movements and and weight training. Mhmm.

[01:22:10]
It's I don't know. First of all, for, like, a lot of fighting type stuff, you you kinda wanna be loose and, like, not super tight. So, but, yeah, I mean, I I just think, like, the the joint stability stuff is you get older and and wanna do this for a longer period of time. It's it's good to do.

[01:22:26]
Yeah. It's huge. It's, mobility in general. It's just, like, so important.

[01:22:30]
You can compete in jujitsu for a long time. Sure. There's, like, all these masters divisions and stuff and yeah. Just those

[01:22:36]
old crazy looking 7 year old dudes trying

[01:22:37]
to kill each other. Yeah. It's

[01:22:38]
nuts. It's great. It is great but for real sincerely, we're very happy. The the I think I could speak rarely do but I think I could speak for the martial arts community. We're very happy that you're bored.

[01:22:51]
It just it makes it it makes it fun that someone is, you know, a prominent intellectual, very intelligent person who's really gotten fascinated by it because it does help to kill that sort of knuckle dragger perspective that a lot of people have about the sport.

[01:23:06]
No. I I think it's super intellectual in terms of actually breaking this stuff down. I mean, both jujitsu and, like, striking. I mean, it's yeah. You don't have time to think, but, like, the reasoning behind why you kind of wanna slip in certain ways and, like, the probability game that you're playing Mhmm.

[01:23:25]
Is, I don't know. I used defense when I was in high school, and I did that pretty competitively. I was never, like, quite good enough to be, like, at the Olympic level, but I was pretty good. And, we virtual fenced last time you were here. Yeah.

[01:23:39]
There we go. And and, like, I, you know, I just remember I would, like, sit in my clbuttes in high school and, like, sketch out combinations of moves and sequences for how to, like, faint and, like, and and kinda trick someone to get them out of position to be able to tap them. And it's, I I I feel like this is like a game in the same way. Mhmm. Right?

[01:24:06]
It's like I mean, I think when when you're training, you're not, like, slugging at each other that much. You're just like you're, you know, playing tag.

[01:24:11]
Yeah. You're playing tag. Well, the way the Thais do it, I think, is the best. And they're obviously some of the best fighters ever. They fight a lot, which is 1 of the reasons why they train the way they train.

[01:24:20]
But when you talk to people that train over there, they're like, you learn so much more when you're playing. You know, when you're doing it, when you're not trying to hurt each other.

[01:24:29]
You know,

[01:24:29]
then you really do learn the technique, like and it gets fully ingrained in your system. Yeah.

[01:24:35]
It's great.

[01:24:36]
Yeah. You just have to be careful brain damage. Like, you were talking about having an MMA fight. Are you still entertaining that?

[01:24:41]
I I want to. I mean, this is my thing. It's like and I I think I probably will, but we'll we'll see. I mean, it's 2025, I think, is gonna be a very busy year on the AI side. Yeah.

[01:24:54]
And I don't like, I I think the idea of having a competition, you really need to, like, get into the headspace of, like, I'm gonna fight someone this week. Mhmm. And, so I need to I need to figure this out because I don't I don't know how with everything that's going on in AI, I'm gonna have, like, a week or 2 where I can just get into this, like, I'm gonna go fight someone. But but it's good it's good training. But and I I would like to at some point.

[01:25:19]
You know, the thing about the ACL injury is I I kind of thought before this, it's like, alright. I'm gonna do some jujitsu competitions. I wanna do 1 MMA fight, like, 1 kind of, like, pro or competitive MMA fight. And then I figured I'd go back to jujitsu, but I think tearing the ACL striking is a little more of a fluke. I think you're much more likely to do that grappling.

[01:25:39]
So going through the ACL experience didn't make me wanna, like, just exclusively go do the version where you're just attacking joints all day long. Right? So Mhmm. I'm like, alright. We can take a few more punches to the face before we go back to that.

[01:25:54]
You can hurt yourself doing both of them. You know? You there's really no rhyme or reason. I blew my left ACLs kickboxing, my right ACL jujitsu.

[01:26:02]
Okay. And that's So equal opportunity.

[01:26:04]
Yeah. I mean, this this, like, Tom Aspinall famously blew his out against Curtis Blaydes with the supporting leg just for

[01:26:10]
a kick

[01:26:10]
and his Yeah. It's freak accidents. Yeah. Weird things happen. You're it's a lot of explosive force with striking, and sometimes that tears things more than slow, controlled movements of jujitsu, especially if you have good training partners.

[01:26:23]
Yeah. But jujitsu isn't always slower controlled

[01:26:25]
Nope. When

[01:26:26]
you're especially when you're competing.

[01:26:27]
No. Especially when you're competing. Unless you're really, really good. Like, you ever watch Gordon? Like, Gordon never moves fast.

[01:26:34]
He doesn't have to. He doesn't have to move fast. He's just, like, always a step ahead of everybody. Have you talked to him at all? Oh, yeah.

[01:26:40]
Did you talk to John Donahue?

[01:26:43]
No. I haven't. You need to talk to him? Yeah. No.

[01:26:44]
I I would be interested in that.

[01:26:45]
That's the greatest mind in combat sports. Now Gordon is the 1 that says I don't say that lightly. John Donahue is the greatest mind in combat sports

[01:26:53]
Interesting.

[01:26:53]
By far. He's a legitimate genius. You know the whole story. Right? The guy was a professor of philosophy at Stanford and just or Columbia?

[01:27:01]
Where was he? I forgot. The Columbia, I think it was.

[01:27:04]
Columbia.

[01:27:04]
And then decides, I'm just gonna teach jiu jitsu all day. Sleeps on the math, teaches all day long, you know. Where's a rash guard anywhere he goes? He's a freak and he's so freaking smart, like, scary smart about all kinds of things. It's not just jujitsu.

[01:27:18]
You know, he's got a a memory like a steel vice, like, he just holds on to thoughts and can repeat them. His recall's insane. He's a a legitimate genius that became obsessed with jujitsu. And what he's done with Gordon and with Gary Toonen and, you know, just a series of other athletes is nothing short of extraordinary. You know?

[01:27:41]
Just an interesting guy to have conversations with too. Have you seen him on Lexus Show? He's done a couple

[01:27:46]
episodes of Lexus. And I watched I I saw the 1 that you did with him

[01:27:50]
too. Love the guy. Yeah. Because, I mean, again, happy there's someone like that that out there. Because when people have these ideas of what martial arts are and then you see a guy like that, you're like, okay.

[01:28:01]
Why? I might have to rethink this.

[01:28:03]
Yeah. There's a there's a whole spectrum of people.

[01:28:06]
Yeah. What has it done in terms of a lot of 1 of the things that a lot of people said and I have too, like, nothing turns you into a libertarian quicker than jiu jitsu.

[01:28:15]
I don't

[01:28:16]
know why that is. I I think it's a hard work thing. It's cutting out all of the bullshoot and realizing how much of the things that we take as real things are just excuses and bullshoot and weakness and just to procrastinate. There's a lot of things that we have that exist, especially in like the business world, in the corporate world, in the education world that are just bullshoot. And they don't really have to be there.

[01:28:40]
Mhmm. And they're only there to try to make up for hard work.

[01:28:43]
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's kinda just what I what I was saying before. I think the for me, it's, just I think a lot of the corporate world is is, like, pretty culturally neutered.

[01:29:03]
And and I I I just think, like, having you know, I I grew up I have 3 sisters, no brothers. I have 3 daughters, no sons. So I'm, like, surrounded by girls and women, like, my my whole life. And it's like so I think, I don't know. There's there's something the the the kind of masculine energy, I think, is is good.

[01:29:24]
And Yeah. Obviously, you know, society has plenty of that, but but I think corporate culture was really, like, trying to get away from it. And I do think that there's just something it's like I don't know. The these all these forms of energy are good, and I think having a culture that, like, celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive. And that's that has been that has been a kind of a positive experience for me.

[01:29:56]
Just, like, having a thing that I can just, like, do with my guy friends and, like Yeah. And it's just, like, we just, like, beat each other a bit. I don't know. It's it's good. It is good.

[01:30:06]
I agree. I don't know.

[01:30:07]
It's good. It just I I could see your point, though, about Yeah. Corporate culture. How when do you think that happened? Was that a slow shift?

[01:30:16]
Because I think it used to be very masculine. And I used to be I think it was kind of hyper aggressive at 1 point

[01:30:21]
in time. Look. And I think part of the the intent on all these things, I think, is good. Right? It's I like, I do think that if you're a a woman going into a company, it probably feels like it's too masculine.

[01:30:32]
It's like there isn't enough of the kind of the energy that that that you may naturally have, and it probably feels like there are all these things that are set up that are biased against you. And that's not good either because you want you want women to be able to succeed and Right. And, like, have companies that can unlock all the value from having great people no matter, you know, what their background or gender. You know? So but but I think these things can all always go a little far.

[01:30:54]
And I think it's 1 thing to say we wanna be kind of, like, welcoming and make a good environment for everyone, and I think it's another to basically say that masculinity is bad. And I I just think we kind of swung culturally to that part of the the kind of

[01:31:10]
Mhmm.

[01:31:11]
The spectrum where, you know, it's all like, okay. Masculinity is toxic. We have to, like, get rid of it completely. It's like, no. Like, it's both of these things are good.

[01:31:19]
Right? It's like you want, like, feminine energy. You want masculine energy. Like, I I think that that's like, you're gonna have parts of society that have more of 1 or the other. I think that that's all good.

[01:31:29]
But, but I do think the corporate culture sort of had swung towards being this somewhat more neutered thing. And I didn't really feel that until I got involved in martial arts, which I think is still a more much more masculine culture. And, so and not not that it doesn't try to be inclusive in its own way, but, but I think that there's just a lot more of that energy there. And I just kind of realized it's like, oh, this

[01:32:01]
is like how you become successful at martial arts. You have to be at least somewhat aggressive.

[01:32:06]
Yeah. So Yeah. But but yeah. I mean, there are these things there are, like, a few of these things throughout your life where you just you have an experience, and you're like, where has this been my whole life? And it just, like, it it just turned on, like, a part of my brain that I was like, okay.

[01:32:20]
Yeah. Like, this was this was a piece of the puzzle that should've been there, and I'm glad it now is.

[01:32:27]
That I felt that way when I started hunting.

[01:32:29]
Oh, yeah. Hunting too.

[01:32:30]
Yeah. Same kind of thing. You've so you've done a lot of that as well.

[01:32:33]
Yeah. Well so, I mean, we have this ranch out in Kauai, and there's invasive pigs. And we on our ranch, we have, there's a lot of albatross. I don't know if they're endangered or just threatened. And then there's the Hawaiian state bird, the, the nene goose is, that's, I think, endangered or or at least was until recently, and, like, most of them in the world live in a small stretch, or at least most of them on Kauai live in a small stretch that includes our ranch.

[01:33:03]
So you constantly have these pigs that are just, like, multiply so quickly, and we basically have to apply pressure to to the population or else they just get overrun and threaten the birds and the other wildlife. And so and what I basically explained to my daughters, who I also want to learn how to do this, because I just feel like it's like, look. We we have this land. We take care of it. Just like you mow the grbutt, we need to make sure that these populations are in check.

[01:33:30]
It's part of what we do as, like, the stewards of this, and, we've gotta do it. And then if you if you have to kill something, then you should, you know, obviously, treat it with respect and, you know, use the the the meat to to make food and and, and and kind of celebrate in that way. But it's it's a culture that I I think it's it's just an important thing for kids to grow up, understanding, like, the circle of life. Right? So, you know, teaching, like, teaching the kids all of, you know, what is is kind of, you know, how you'd run a ranch, how you'd run a farm.

[01:34:05]
I think that that stuff it's good. I mean, because, you know, explaining to the kids what a tech company is is really abstract. Right? So for a while, my daughters were pretty convinced that my actual job was Mark's Meats, which is our, our kind of ranch and, like, the cattle that we that we ranch. I was, like, well, not quite, and you'll learn when you get older.

[01:34:29]
But, but I I think that there's something that's just, like, much more tangible about that than, you know, taking them to the office and, you know, sitting in product reviews or something for for some, like, piece of software that we're writing.

[01:34:41]
Well, it's certainly a lot more primal. Yeah. Yeah. And if you do wind up eating that meat from the animal and you were there while the animal died, like, you put it all together, like, oh, this is where meat comes from.

[01:34:53]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:34:55]
Which is another reason why things have become sort of emasculated because that energy is not necessary anymore to acquire meat. You know, that used to be the

[01:35:03]
only way that people

[01:35:04]
got meat. You had to go hunt it. So you had to go actually pull the trigger, kill the animal yourself, cut it up, butcher it, cook it. You knew what you were doing.

[01:35:13]
Yeah. Although my favorite is bow, bow and arrow. Mhmm. I mean, that's, I I think, like, the most that that feels like the most kind of sporting version of it.

[01:35:22]
Yeah. If you wanna put it that way. Yeah. I mean, if you're just trying to get meat, it's not the most effective. The most effective is certainly a rifle.

[01:35:29]
But, I prefer it because it's it requires more of you.

[01:35:35]
Yeah. And you just kinda go and hang out and Yeah.

[01:35:38]
And you have to be fit. Yeah. Especially if you're mountain hunting, you have to be really fit. Yeah. You can't just be kind of in shape.

[01:35:44]
You gotta be really fit. If you wanna huff up the mountains and keep your heart rate at a certain level so that when you get to the top, you can execute a shot calmly.

[01:35:53]
And then actually carry the thing out.

[01:35:54]
Yeah. Yeah. And carry the thing out.

[01:35:56]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. I I'm I mostly mostly use a rifle just because it's so much more efficient.

[01:36:02]
You know, your your conversion rate is so much higher, but it's, but, yeah, another What kind of bow do you have? Gosh. I didn't get to do it this season, but, do you

[01:36:15]
know the company that makes it?

[01:36:17]
Not off the top of my head.

[01:36:18]
I mean you have to know.

[01:36:19]
Yeah. No. This is embarrbutting. This is embarrbutting.

[01:36:23]
I can get you hooked up.

[01:36:24]
Yeah. I it works. Okay. Do you know how old it is? No.

[01:36:29]
It's it's not old. Okay. I think it's it's like a just a compound bow that I got strung to my draw length and

[01:36:37]
Did you get someone to coach you?

[01:36:39]
Yeah. Yeah. Who coached you? It's basically a bunch of the guys who who, you know, help run security around the ranch.

[01:36:46]
Okay. Yeah. The thing about archery is just like martial arts, 1 of the things that I learned when I was teaching is that it's way easier to teach someone that knows nothing than to teach someone who learned something incorrectly. The people who learned something incorrectly. The moment, things got tense and they panicked, they went back to the old ways, because it's sort of ingrained in their system.

[01:37:10]
So archery, 1 of the things that's very important is proper form and then proper execution, especially having a surprise shot. And learning how to have a surprise shot is

[01:37:22]
What what do you mean?

[01:37:23]
Yeah. See. You don't know.

[01:37:25]
No. See, that's not

[01:37:26]
this is the thing. In high pressure situations, 1 of the most important things is to have, a shot process where you don't know exactly when the arrow is going off. You just have a process where you're pulling through the shot and the shot breaks. So it's a surprise shot. So you put the pin on the target.

[01:37:46]
Mhmm. I use a a thumb trigger. I use a Yeah.

[01:37:49]
I do too.

[01:37:50]
I use a thing called an onyx clicker.

[01:37:52]
Okay.

[01:37:52]
And the reason why I use the onyx clicker is like a hinge. It gives you a 2 stage of the trigger. Right? So as I'm at full draw, I put slight pressure and I hear a click. And that click means it's ready to go off with more pressure.

[01:38:06]
So I've gone through stage 1. Now stage 2 is just concentrating on the shot process and knowing it's gonna break. And then there's no flinching. There's no tweak. There's no there's no other thing that people do when they have a a finger trigger where they they twitch because your your body is anticipating the shock of the bow.

[01:38:26]
And when you're doing that, you can be off by 6 inches, 4 inches, 5 inches, all over the place because you're moving. You're moving while you're you're shooting. When you're doing it with a rifle, it's very different because, obviously, a rifle's far faster.

[01:38:39]
Yeah.

[01:38:40]
And then you have a scope. So you're, you know, you're you're zoomed in many magnifications and all you have to do is just slowly squeeze. And if you're smart, you'll be prone or you'll have your rifle rested on a tripod or something where you have a good steady. It's much easier. With a bow, it's very different because you're holding with your arms so you have to have the proper form, you have to have the proper posture, and then there's this thought process.

[01:39:03]
And my friend Joel Turner who is a, sniper created a whole system for people called ShotIQ. Mhmm. He's got this whole online system of developing the proper execution of a shot. When you see, like, tournament archers when they go to Vegas so what a Vegas tournament is, you have 3 targets and they have to shoot 30 arrows at a time. So they shoot 10 in this 1, 10 in that 1, 10 in this 1.

[01:39:29]
And the really good archers score an x every time. So in the they're in the center or close to the center. They're hitting the 10 ring every arrow for 30 arrows in a row, and then there's round after round, another 30 hours with new people, another 30 and if you miss slightly, you get a 9, that's it. You're done. Because all these other guys are not gonna get a 9.

[01:39:49]
Very rarely will they. You know? So most it's the the most tens that you can get, and the best way to do that is with a surprise shot. So these guys have, like, these long stabilizers on their bow where they keep it totally steady, and it's all just about relaxing. And most of them use a hinge release.

[01:40:07]
Or so a hinge you know what a hinge is? Have you ever used 1? Okay. Instead of a button Mhmm. You press it Mhmm.

[01:40:13]
You're rotating the hinge, which activates the shield.

[01:40:17]
I just have a trigger.

[01:40:18]
Yeah. Yeah. So you're just hammering the trigger. You're doing exactly what you're not supposed to do. You're a trigger puncher.

[01:40:22]
Yeah. You're a trigger puncher.

[01:40:23]
With your thumb?

[01:40:24]
Yeah. You're you're hitting it with your thumb. Right? Uh-huh. Yeah.

[01:40:26]
I guarantee you, when you do it, your arm doesn't move. You go like this. Like that. Uh-huh. So with a good surprise shot, you shouldn't know it's gonna go off.

[01:40:33]
You're pulling. And then once the trigger breaks off, your arm will naturally go backwards because you're not anticipating the shot.

[01:40:41]
I'm definitely not doing that.

[01:40:42]
Yeah. See, that's the thing. You're like

[01:40:43]
But how how far away are you shooting things from?

[01:40:46]
It depends. That elk out there, the photograph that's in the front, that 1 I shot, it's, in the front of the building when you walk in before you go into the studio. There's a an a mounted head and then a photograph of me and my friend Cam. That 1 was 67 yards. I shot 1 at 79 yards once, but that's rare.

[01:41:04]
Most of the time, it's like, for me, my effective range, my like, where I'd like to be is 60 yards and in.

[01:41:11]
Yeah. Because I was gonna say, I don't think I've ever shot something more than 50 yards out. Yeah. It's hard. Yeah.

[01:41:17]
So so I think that

[01:41:18]
really, you know, real your form has to be tight. You have to be really confident. You have to have a lot of arrows down range. And then you have to be able to stay calm during the shot. So now imagine if you're shooting something at 18 yards.

[01:41:30]
Okay? And you hammer the trigger. A little bit of this, a little bit of that, you're still gonna get there. Yeah. Right?

[01:41:35]
Because it's only 18 yards. So the the amount of deviation off the path that it takes in 18 yards is significantly different than the amount of deviation a 105 yards. It's a huge gap. It might be 2 feet to the right. Yeah.

[01:41:48]
Meanwhile, you thought you were shooting accurately because you're inside of, like, a pie plate at 20 yards. And the difference between that is form, technique, and a shot execution process, and also management of the psychology of the shot. Because this is 1 moment. Here it comes. Yeah.

[01:42:06]
Here it comes now.

[01:42:08]
Mhmm.

[01:42:08]
And if you only do that once a year, like, say if you go on 1 big elk hunt a year, you save up all your money, you get your gear all ready, you get your arrows weighed, you practice, and then you're in the mountains for 10 days. And on 11th day, you get this animal that moves. It's at 57 yards and stands there, and you're like, your heart's beating. You just might hammer that trigger. You just might hammer it.

[01:42:31]
So you have to have this shot process and where you you're literally talking to yourself inside your head. You have words that you say that occupy your thoughts while you're going through the shot process so that you never get overcome by shot panic. Interesting. Because target panic is a giant thing in the archery community. It's giant.

[01:42:52]
Even saying it is like saying Voldemort. It's like, don't say it. People don't wanna say it. It's like saying Candyman. Like, people don't like it because it it freaks people out.

[01:43:02]
Like, the they'll dig some people can't keep their pin on the target. They have to keep their pin below the target and then they raise it up to the target. When it gets where the target is, they hammer the trigger because they're just freaking out. Yeah. Have you ever experienced that?

[01:43:17]
I mean, I've missed, if that's what you're asking. I I haven't analyzed it this level of detail. But no. I mean, there are a lot of bores on our ranch, so I guess I don't I don't get yeah. And, also, like, we have a range, and and we, I don't know.

[01:43:33]
We set up bowling pins and, you know, it's like we shoot pistols at the bowling pins, but I also like just like I I I'm usually faster at taking down all the bowling pins with a bow and arrow than most of my friends are with the pistol, which I think is is is pretty fun. But yeah. No. I mean, just more casual. I'm I'm clearly not doing it at your level, and then maybe you've given me another, side quest to maybe go deeper on.

[01:43:55]
But That's

[01:43:55]
what I'm saying.

[01:43:56]
But I I'll take you on

[01:43:57]
an elk hunt in the mountains. Yeah. You'll get addicted. I do think about I do think the dynamic

[01:44:03]
that you're talking about, though, where if you only see 1 animal on a multi day, then, like, that is just way higher stakes than anything that I'm doing. I mean, I'd say not everything

[01:44:14]
that you're doing. Because if you're really considering having an MMA fight, it's very similar. Because you're building up to this

[01:44:19]
1 moment. Sure. I'm talking about the archery that I'm doing. Right. I mean, it's like, I go out.

[01:44:23]
It's like, you're gonna see some pigs, and, like, and it's like, if I don't if I don't hit any, it's like, my family's still eating. It's okay. You know? So I'm not like, you know, but Right.

[01:44:32]
Yeah. But if it's like martial arts is what I'm saying. It's like, you really should learn it the right way from the beginning.

[01:44:38]
You can verify I've clearly not learned this in a very rigorous way. I'll hook you up. Yeah. I can get people to come in. A video on Instagram once of me, I I think, hitting bowling pins with archery.

[01:44:49]
And, like, all the comments are like, man, your form is shoot. So, so I think it checks out with the conversation that we're having now.

[01:44:56]
Well, the the issue with that is that you're reading the comments. Like You should never read comments.

[01:45:00]
That's fair. That's fair.

[01:45:02]
I've never had anything good come out of reading comments.

[01:45:05]
Yeah. Although, I don't know. It's pretty funny. I think the just, like, getting the the the gist and the summary of it, I think, is is is pretty funny.

[01:45:13]
Yeah. It's funny. It's just not mentally healthy.

[01:45:16]
Yeah. No. You can't spend too much time on it.

[01:45:17]
I don't spend any time on it. Yeah. I'd I'm a much happier person since I, like, avoided comments. Yeah. It's just too weird.

[01:45:24]
You're just delving into the world of all these people's mental illness and screaming at people and just, I don't I don't want anything to do with it.

[01:45:31]
Yeah. But, I mean, I I do read my friends' comments, and when even they're, like, man, that's ugly. Like, that's I do that.

[01:45:38]
I do that, and I shouldn't do that. But I definitely don't send them to them. Hey, bro. Did you see this?

[01:45:43]
Those guys are the worst.

[01:45:45]
Guys that'll send things to you that are about you. You're like, hey, man. Don't. I'm not looking for that. Don't send it to me.

[01:45:50]
I don't I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Social media is it's like what a weird new pressure, you know. And children today are going through some bizarre stress that we've never had to go through before.

[01:46:03]
And a bizarre sort of, just disconnect from physical reality by most of your communication being electronic.

[01:46:12]
Yeah. And I think, you know, we basically my kids at this point are 9, 7, and, and 1a half.

[01:46:20]
So we got So you're not interested in that? Or you're not No.

[01:46:22]
No. I I would rather of

[01:46:23]
course, you're interested. I mean, interested. I mean, involved. We're very

[01:46:26]
focused on it. We would now. I think that it's about to start getting a lot more complicated. Mhmm. I think, you know, the 9 and and 7 year old.

[01:46:33]
But, I mean, just kind of deciding what technology they're gonna use and what's good and what's not and Mhmm. All the dynamics around that. It's, it's, it's really complicated. I and then, look. I mean, I think every family has their own values in how they wanna approach this.

[01:46:50]
Right? So from my perspective, you know, our we have 1 of my daughters just, like, loves building stuff. So she clearly, like, takes after me in this way. It's like, every day, she's just, like, creating some random thing. It's like she's creating stuff with Legos and, you know, it's like, 1 day it's that or, you know, the next day it's Minecraft.

[01:47:10]
And from my perspective, it's like, okay. I don't know. Minecraft is actually kind of a cooler tool to build stuff than than Legos a lot of the way. So it's, you know, it's am I gonna say that there's gonna there there there needs to be some kind of limit on on her screen time if if she's doing something that's creative, that's maybe, like, a richer form of what she would have been doing physically? Right.

[01:47:30]
In that case, probably not. Now there were times when, she'd get so excited about what she was building in Minecraft or or something that she was coding in Scratch that she'd wake up early to kinda get her tablet. And that was bad, right, because then it's, like, starting to get in the way of her sleep. And I'm like, you know, August, you you can't do that. Right?

[01:47:50]
It's like we're gonna take your your iPad away if you're doing that. You little psycho. Wait. Don't get up early. No.

[01:47:56]
It's like it's like August. I did that too when I was a kid, but trust me

[01:48:01]
Yeah.

[01:48:02]
You're gonna wanna sleep.

[01:48:02]
It's not gonna lead to success meanwhile you're on a freaking island.

[01:48:05]
Yeah. No. It's yeah. It's 1

[01:48:08]
of the richest people in the world. Your dad like, what the freak, dad?

[01:48:12]
Yeah.

[01:48:12]
Didn't it work for you?

[01:48:13]
I mean, you know

[01:48:14]
Leave me alone, my iPad. I'm trying to figure out how to build a a mansion and

[01:48:17]
Yeah. My crap. It's either gonna work or it's gonna end badly. But Right. But it's like but I feel like, like building stuff, I feel generally pretty good about.

[01:48:27]
Mhmm.

[01:48:27]
I think communication, I generally feel pretty good about the kids using. I mean, they use it to talk to their grandparents, right, or parents and

[01:48:34]
Mhmm.

[01:48:34]
Cousins. You know, it's like that that type of stuff is good. The Messenger Kids, the thing that we built, is basically like a messaging service that the parents can choose who can contact the kids and, like, just approve every contact. Mhmm. That's much better than just having, like, an open texting service.

[01:48:50]
But I don't know, but there's a lot of stuff that's, like, pretty sketchy. And I kinda think, like, different parents are gonna have different lines on what they want their kids to be able to do and not. Yeah. You know, so some people might not even want their kids to be able to message even with friends when they're 9 and 7. Some people might say, hey.

[01:49:06]
No. Minecraft, that's just a game. I don't think about that as building. I think that is a game. I wanna limit the time that you're doing that.

[01:49:11]
I want you to go read books instead or whatever whatever the the values are that that family has. So for Meta, what we've kinda come to is we wanna be the most aligned with parents on giving parents the tools that they need to basically control how the experiences work for their kids. Now we don't even really, except for, like, stuff like Messenger Kids, we don't even have our services, our apps generally available to people under the age of 13 at all. So, I mean, our kids, I haven't had to, like, have the conversation about when when they get Instagram or Facebook or any of that stuff. But, but when they turn 13, we basically want parents to be able to have complete control over the kids' experience.

[01:49:54]
And that's you know, we just rolled out this Instagram teens thing, which is it's a set of of controls where, you know, it's if you if you're an older teen, we'll just default you into the private experience. That way, you're not getting, like, harbutted or bombarded with stuff. And, but if you're a younger teen, then you have to get your parents' permission, and and they actually have to, like, sign in and and do all the stuff in order to make it so that you can connect with people who are beyond your network or, if you wanna kinda be a public figure, like, all all these different kinds of things. So I think that that's probably, from a values perspective, where we should be is just trying to, like, be an ally of parents. But but it is complicated stuff.

[01:50:33]
I mean, it's every family wants to do it differently.

[01:50:36]
It is complicated, and there's also this dismissal of activities that are done electronically as not being beneficial. And 1 of the things that we highlighted recently was a study that we found online that showed that surgeons that play video games

[01:50:49]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:50]
Make far less mistakes.

[01:50:52]
Interesting. Yeah. Well, the people who do the training in VR definitely make less mistakes.

[01:50:56]
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, that is, to me Yeah. 1 of the most fascinating aspects of technology today. You know, when you and I were doing that, game or fencing with each other, I'm like, this could be applied to so many different things now.

[01:51:11]
It's like the there's so many opportunities, not just for just pure recreation, but education. There's so many things you could learn skills through AR or VR Mhmm.

[01:51:24]
That it

[01:51:25]
you're it's it'll greatly enhance your ability to do those things in the real world. I mean, it's a it's a real it's kind of a cheat code in a lot of ways. And it's also games in VR. I I don't know if you ever done sandbox. You ever do sandbox?

[01:51:40]
Which

[01:51:40]
You know sandbox VR? Do you know what that company is?

[01:51:42]
Yeah. You go

[01:51:43]
to a warehouse, you put on a haptic feedback test. Yeah. You shoot zombies. Yeah. I'm so addicted.

[01:51:48]
I'm so addicted. It is my favorite thing. There's a thing called Deadwood Mansion. It's the most fun game of all time by far. You have a shotgun, and there's zombies coming at you.

[01:51:59]
I want you

[01:51:59]
to catch me. My my zombie game is Arizona Sunshine.

[01:52:02]
Oh, is that 1?

[01:52:03]
0, it's it's you just like it's can be multiplayer, and there's horde mode where you just get in there, and they're, like, 4 friends, and there's just, like, waves of zombies come, and you're killing them all.

[01:52:14]
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I have to try it. Yeah. I haven't tried that 1 yet.

[01:52:17]
That's my it's very therapeutic. You just wait until they come into point blank range.

[01:52:22]
How long before you guys develop some sort of a haptic feedback suit where, like, it covers the whole body?

[01:52:27]
Oh, man. Is that possible? It's possible. I think that there's other things that are probably more important to deliver. So, I guess, taking a step back.

[01:52:42]
A lot of how we think about the goal here is delivering, like, a realistic sense of presence. Right? No technology today gives you the feeling as if you're, like, physically there with another person. Right? You're you're, like, interacting with them through a phone.

[01:52:55]
You have this, like, little window. It's kinda taking you away from everything. And that's, like, the magic of augmented and virtual reality is, like, you actually feel this, like, presence. Like, you're there with another person.

[01:53:06]
And Right.

[01:53:07]
So the question is, okay. How do you do that? And it's like there's, like, a million things that that contribute to that. I mean, obviously, first, just being able to look around and have the the room stay. Getting good spatial audio.

[01:53:19]
Right? If someone speaks, then it should give the audio need it needs to be 3 d and come from the place where they're speaking. It's actually it's very interesting which things end up being important for the this kind of creating the sense of presence and which don't. So having hands, obviously, if you're just looking around, but you can't actually, like, move things, that that that breaks the illusion. But having hands, like, hand tracking that you can do stuff is important.

[01:53:46]
1 thing that we found that's kinda funny is it's actually not that important that you see your arms. You just need to see your hands. Obviously, seeing your arms is a bonus unless we incorrectly interpolate where your elbows are or something. So if we have if we're looking at your hand or we if we have a controller, we can know, okay. Your hand is here.

[01:54:06]
But that doesn't necessarily tell us where your elbow is. So your arm could be like this. It could be like this. So we can kinda guess from the but if we get that wrong and you, like, see in VR, it's like, you see the hand there and your elbow is like looks like it's here when it's actually out there. You're like, ah, what what's going on?

[01:54:21]
Like, that's messed up. So it's a lot of these things. Like, you just don't wanna get these details wrong. So haptics, the most important first thing for haptics is on the hand. Right?

[01:54:32]
I mean, we have so many more, the neurons, basically, and or, not neurons, but just like the the like, sensation. It's it's, like, such higher resolution, on your on your fingertips than anywhere else in the body. So, you know, when you grab something, you know, making it so that you feel some pushback. Right? When you there's a lot of gaming systems at this point where if you, like, pull a trigger, you get, like, a little bit of a rumble or something.

[01:54:58]
We built this 1 thing

[01:55:01]
where it's

[01:55:01]
like a ping pong paddle with a sensor in it, and it you you feel the ball hit like, the virtual ball hitting the ping pong paddle. Mhmm. And it feels like like, when you're actually playing ping pong, it doesn't it's not like a generic thing where it just, like, you feel it hit the paddle. You feel where it hits the paddle. Mhmm.

[01:55:21]
Then we basically built a system where now with this, like, physical paddle, you can kind of it the the haptics make it so you can feel where the ball hits the paddle. Oh. So it's like all these things, like, are just going towards delivering a more realistic experience. So full body haptics. So there are some things that I think it could do.

[01:55:45]
Like, if you get if you're playing a boxing game, you get punched in the stomach, you can probably simulate something like that a little. It's not gonna be able to deliver that much force. So, I mean, I guess that's maybe a good thing because no 1 wants to get Right. Punched in the stomach that hard. But but, like, it's not gonna be able to deliver enough force for you to for example, let's say you're not just boxing, you're kickboxing.

[01:56:15]
Like, I don't know. You need something on the other side to be able to complete it. Right? Because it it's like when you kick, when you when you're, when you're just practicing, it's like you you you spin. Right?

[01:56:25]
Because you don't wanna just, like, stop. And it's, you know, it's like like the the shadowing of kick. Like, there's not gonna be anything that you can do as, like, a, you know, single person playing VR with a haptic suit that, like, makes it so that you're gonna be able to kick someone who's not there physically and actually be able to do that. Right. So, like, grappling, it's like I I don't I think that that like, jujitsu is gonna be the last thing that we're able to do in in in VR because you, like, need the momentum of the other person and to be able to move them.

[01:56:54]
The boxing thing is actually good. Boxing works.

[01:56:57]
Yeah. Yeah. Boxing works. Even and you don't really need the haptics. I think it would be better with it.

[01:57:03]
That's probably 1 of the better cases. I think it's that and getting shot or, like, sword fighting type stuff.

[01:57:08]
Mhmm.

[01:57:09]
So you can, like, just feel feel it on your body. But I don't know. I I think what's basically gonna end up happening is you're gonna have, like, a home setup for these things, and then you're gonna have there are these, like, location based services where, like, people, it's almost like a theme park where you can go into, and it can and you can have, like, a a really immersive VR experience where it's not just that you get, like, a a vest that can simulate some haptics. It's that you're also, like, in a real physical environment. So they can, like, have smoke come out or something, and you can smell that and feel that or, like, spray some water and it feels humid.

[01:57:47]
And, I think that it it still is gonna be a while before you can just, like, virtually create all those sensations. So I think a lot of those really rich experiences are gonna be in these very constructed environments.

[01:57:58]
Is the bridge when they figure out some sort of a neural interface? So instead of having these extraneous things, instead instead of having, like, a fan blowing at you or, you know, the ground moves a little bit, have everything happen inside your head.

[01:58:16]
Well, you know, in terms of neural interfaces, there are 2 approaches to the problem, roughly. Right? There's the kind of jacket into your brain neural interface, and then there's the risk based neural interface thing that, you know, we we showed you for Orion, the smart

[01:58:31]
glbuttes. Yeah.

[01:58:32]
And I I would guess that, you know, I think it's gonna be a while before, we're really widely deploying anything that jacks into your brain. I think that there are a lot of people who don't wanna be the early adopters of that technology. You wanna, like, wait until that's pretty mature before you get that.

[01:58:48]
For sure.

[01:58:48]
I mean, for and that's basically gonna get started in medical use cases. Right? So if someone, like, loses sensation part of their body, and now you have the ability to fix that.

[01:58:57]
Like the first Neurolink patient.

[01:58:59]
Yeah. So I I think you'll basically start with people who have pretty severe conditions, who the upside is very significant before you start, like, jacking people into play games better. Right?

[01:59:10]
Right.

[01:59:11]
But a risk based thing, I mean, that's something I mean, like, people wear stuff on their wrist all the time. Right? So, and what we basically found there, that doesn't do input to you, but it's good for giving you the ability to control a computer. Because, basically, you have all these extra neurons that go from your brain to controlling your hand. Your hand is, like, super complicated.

[01:59:33]
And there's actually all these extra pathways, because for for a bunch of reasons. Neuroplasticity in case you, like, lose the ability to use 1, they wanna be able to have others. So you want the redundancy because being able to use your hand is super important. So in normal use, we've kind of all figured out some patterns of how we send signals from our brain to our hand. And, I mean, the reality is there's, like, all these other patterns too that are unused today.

[02:00:02]
So you can put a wristband on your wrist that can measure activity across these neurons. And today, we're starting by basically measuring as you're doing as you're, like, moving your fingers. But over a few versions of this we're gonna get to is, like, you won't actually even have to move your hand. You'll just, like, trigger these neurons in opposing ways. It's like, you probably can't see right now.

[02:00:25]
It's like I'm kinda flexing something in this finger and something here. So, like, it's not actually moving, but there's some signal that the neural interface wristband, if I were wearing it, could pick up. And I just think we're gonna be we're gonna, like, have glbuttes, and we're gonna be able to be here. And I'm, like, gonna be able to, like, you know, text my wife or friends or something or text AI and, like, get an answer to something. It's like, I forgot something while we were talking.

[02:00:49]
Let me just text AI. Okay. I just did that. It's, like, did

[02:00:52]
you do it in a way? Sitting there without anyone even looking at your way.

[02:00:56]
And you have glbuttes and, like, the answer just comes into your glbuttes. I mean, for me, 1 of the 1 of the positive things when when COVID hit, everyone in software basically started working remotely for a while, because you can. Right? Software. It's like, okay.

[02:01:12]
Whatever. You don't have to be in the office. You can you can kinda be in different places. And a lot of the meetings went on to Zoom. And 1 of the best things about that, was basically you you were able to politely have all these side conversations.

[02:01:27]
Right? So it's like when you're seeing someone in person, it would be super rude if I, like, pulled out my phone and, like, just started texting someone. It would just be really weird. Right? Yeah.

[02:01:35]
But when you're, like, talking to someone online, it's like I don't know. I guess, because they either can't tell your attention because it's, like because there's not good presence or if it's just the norm. But they're like you have, like, the main group conversation. And then I was like, at least the norm for me was I could just, like, text different people on the side. It's like, okay.

[02:01:54]
What do you think at this point that this person is making in this meeting? Right. Like, in normal life, it's like, oftentimes, I'd have, you know, some discussion that I'd have to, like, sync up with people afterwards about how'd that go. But now it's like, I could just do that all at the same time. Right?

[02:02:07]
It's like you're having the group discussion, and you're having the conversations with the people about the discussion that you're having in real time. But you can only do that over Zoom. So I think being able to do that in kind of physical interactions, where you're just, like, you're interacting with people, and you can just, like, use an AI augmentation to be able to get extra context or help help you think through something, or remember something, just to be able to kind of have a better conversation, be able to, you know, not have to follow-up on something after the fact. I I think, like, it's gonna be super useful for for all these different things.

[02:02:41]
Well, it certainly can be, but I think that also opens up the opportunity for people to be even more disconnected. Because if you're sort of connected to other things while you're physically in the presence of someone so So you're having a conversation with someone, but you're also, like, searching, like, where you wanna eat that night. Uh-huh. You know, like because people are gonna use it for that as well.

[02:03:00]
Yeah. You know, I actually think it'll be a lot better on that. Because right now yeah. Because I mean, right now, we have our phones, but we're, like you know, it's like you're like, it it takes you away from, like, the physical environment around you. Mhmm.

[02:03:11]
You're you're kinda, like, sucked into this little screen. I think now in the future, our computing platform as it becomes more of, like, a glbuttes or eventually contact lens form factor is you're gonna actually the the Internet is gonna get overlaid on the physical world. So it's not like we have the physical world, and now I have all my digital stuff through this tiny little window. In the future, it'll be, okay. All my attention goes to the world.

[02:03:37]
The world consists of physical things and virtual things that are overlaid on it. Mhmm. You know, so if we wanted to, you know, play poker or something, you know, it's a, you know, we could have a physical deck of cards, or we could just have a virtual kind of hologram deck of cards and snap your hands. Here's the deck of cards. And, like, our friend who can't be here physically, like, he's here as a hologram, but he can play with the the the kind of digital deck of cards.

[02:04:02]
Also, I think, you know, let's say you're, like, doing something at work. You're working on a project. I think in the future, we'll have AI coworkers. Those people won't even they're they're not even people. They won't be able to be embodied.

[02:04:11]
So if you're having a physical meeting, you're sitting around with a bunch of people, they couldn't show up, as as, like, you know, part of the team no matter what. But I I think, like, we'll get to a point where just like your friend can show up in a hologram, and, like, your your AI colleagues will be able to also. So I I think, like, we'll basically be in this wild world where it's like like, most of the world will be physical, but there'll be this increasing amount of, like, virtual objects or people who are kinda beaming in or, like, hologramming into different things to interact in different ways. And, I actually think that natural blending of the kind of digital world and the physical is way more natural than the segmentation that we have today where it's like, you're in the physical world, and now I'm just gonna go tune it out to look at my my, like, I'm gonna access the whole digital universe through this, like, 5 inch screen.

[02:05:03]
Right.

[02:05:03]
So I don't know. It's just it seems natural to me. It's like that's this is the world. There isn't, like, a physical world and a digital world anymore. We're in, you know, 2025.

[02:05:11]
It's 1 world. Like, these these things should get blended.

[02:05:14]
God, that's such a weird concept, but it's true. I mean, that's where we're headed. We're certainly headed into deeper and deeper integration. It's not like things are moving away. You know, we're we're headed to deeper and deeper integration with technology and AI.

[02:05:29]
And it's inevitable, you know? It seems like it's just it's on this march, and there's not a lot we're gonna be able to do to stop that march. Just we gotta hope that the right people are in control of AI when it becomes God.

[02:05:41]
Or that it becomes widely available. I mean, I I kind of liked the the theory that it's only God if only kind of, like, 1 company or government controls it. Right? It's like if if you were the only person who had access to a computer and the Internet, you would have this, like, inhuman power that everyone else didn't have because you could use Google, and you could, like Right. Get access to all this stuff.

[02:06:05]
But the but then when everyone has it, it, it makes us all better, but it's also, like, kind of an even playing field. So that's kind of what we're going for with this whole open source thing is I just, like I don't think that there's gonna be, like, 1 AI. I certainly don't think that there should be 1 company that controls AI. I think you, like, want there to be a diversity of different things and a diversity of people creating different, different things with it. I mean, some of it will be kinda serious and helping you think through things.

[02:06:37]
I think, like, with anything on the Internet, a lot of it is just gonna be funny and, like, fun and content, and people are gonna create agents that are, like like, AIs that are entertaining, and they'll pbutt them around almost like content where it's, like, just like you you pbutt around, like, a reel or a video, and you're like, this thing is fun. Like, in the future, like a like a video, it's not interactive. You know, you you watch it, and you're consuming it. But I think a lot of more entertainment in the future will be inherently interactive where someone will kind of sculpt an experience or an AI, and then they'll show show someone. It's like, oh, this is funny.

[02:07:08]
But, like, it's not necessarily they're gonna interact with that AI every day. It's like, okay. It's funny for 5 minutes, and then you pbutt it along to your friends. And, so I don't know. I think I think you like I think you want the world to have all these different things.

[02:07:20]
And I think that's probably also, from my perspective, the best way to make sure that it doesn't get out of control is to make it so that it's pretty equally distributed.

[02:07:33]
I think the the problem that people have with it is not even whether or not it gets equally distributed. It's that if it becomes sentient and it goes on its own. The the the fear that people have, the general fear that we're gonna become obsolete is that human beings are essentially creating a superior version of higher intelligence that will be powered by quantum computing and connected to nuclear reactors, and it's gonna have, like, this ungodly ability to

[02:08:05]
well, first

[02:08:05]
of all, they've already shown that, AI has learned to code. I mean, this is 1 of the things that OpenAI said that they're Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's they're learning how to code their own AI. Uh-huh.

[02:08:16]
I think this year, probably in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are gonna have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid level engineer that you have at your company that can write code.

[02:08:36]
Mhmm.

[02:08:37]
And once you have that, then in the beginning, it'll be really expensive to run, and then you can get it to be more efficient. And then over time, we'll get to the point where a lot of the code in our apps and and including the AI that we generate is actually gonna be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers. But but I don't know. I I think that that'll augment the people working on it. So in my my view on this is, like, the future, people are just gonna be so much more creative, and they're gonna be freed up to do kinda crazy things.

[02:09:04]
Goes back to you know, my daughter was, like, playing with LEGOs before, and Mhmm. They kinda ran out of LEGOs. And then now she can have Minecraft and can build whatever she wants, and it's so much better. Just like I think it's the future versions of this stuff

[02:09:17]
are just gonna

[02:09:18]
be wild.

[02:09:18]
But Unquestionably. Yeah. Another concern that people have is that it's gonna eliminate a lot of jobs. Yeah. You know?

[02:09:24]
What do

[02:09:24]
you think about that? Well, I I think it's too it's too early to know exactly how it plays out. But my guess is that it'll probably create more creative jobs than it well, I I guess if you look at the history of all this stuff Mhmm. My my understanding is, like, a 100 years ago. In in I don't know if this is a 100 or a 150 years ago, but it was, like, at some point, not too far along, in in the grand scheme of things.

[02:09:55]
Like, the vast majority of people in society were farmers. Right? Because they kinda needed to be in order to create enough food for for everyone to survive. And then we turned that into a in, like, an industrial process, And now it's, like, 2% of society are farmers, and we get all the food that we need. So what did that free up everyone else to do?

[02:10:16]
Well, some of them went on to do other things that are sort of, like, creative pursuits or cultural pursuits or other jobs, and then some percent of it just went towards recreation. Right? So I think, generally, people just don't work as many hours, today as they did when back when everyone needed to farm in order to have enough food for everyone to survive. So I think that trend is sort of played out as technology has grown. And so my guess is that, like, the percent of people who will be doing stuff that's, like, physically required for humanity to survive will get to be smaller and smaller as it has.

[02:10:56]
More people will dedicate themselves to kind of creative and artistic and cultural pursuits. I think that's generally good. I think the number of hours in a week that someone will have to work in order to be able to get by will probably continue to shrink. Yet, I think people who are super engaged in what they do are going to be able to work really hard and accomplish way more than they ever could before, because they have, like, this unimaginable leverage from from having a lot more technology. So I think that that, if you just, like, fast forwarded or extrapolated out the hit the historical technological trend is what you'd get.

[02:11:33]
I think the question is what you raised, which is, is this qualitatively a different type of thing that somehow, obsolets people? But I I just think when you're asking that, it's just important to remind ourselves that, like, at every step along the way of human progress and technology, people thought that the technology that we were developing was gonna obsolete people. So maybe this time, it's really different. But I would guess that what'll happen is that the technology will get integrated into, like, everything that we do, which again is why I think it's really important that it's open source, and that it's widely available. So that way, it's not just, like, 1 company or 1 government kinda monopolizing the whole thing.

[02:12:16]
And I guess that if we do it in that way, we'll all just kind of have superpowers is my is my guess, rather than it it sort of creating some kind of a runaway thing. I mean, it's well, 1 of the things I think has been interesting, this is maybe going in a somewhat different direction than than what you're asking, not or a different take on the question, is I think 1 of the more interesting philosophical findings from the work in AI so far is, I think, people conflate a number of factors into what makes a person a person. So there's intelligence. There's will. There's consciousness, and, like, I think we kind of think about those 3 things as as if they're somehow all the same.

[02:13:09]
Right? It's like if you're intelligent, then you must also have a, like, a goal for what you're trying to do, or you must have some sort of consciousness. But I think, like, 1 of the crazier sort of philosophical results from the fact that, okay, you have, like, Meta AI or Chat GPT today, and it's just kinda sitting there, and you can ask it a question and deploy, like, a ton of intelligence to answer a question, and then it just kinda shuts itself down. Like, that's intelligence that is just sitting there without either having a will or consciousness.

[02:13:41]
Mhmm.

[02:13:42]
And, like, I just think it's not a super obvious result that that would be the case. But I think that a lot of people, they anthropomorphize this stuff. And when you're thinking about kind of science fiction, you think that, okay, you're gonna get to something that's, like, super smart. It's gonna, like, want something or, like, be able to feel. And

[02:14:03]
Well, you know that chatgpt tried to copy itself when it found out it was being shut down, tried to rewrite its code.

[02:14:10]
I I'm not sure what this is. What is this?

[02:14:13]
You weren't aware of that? Yeah. Fairly recently. Jamie pulled it up. We talked about it the other day.

[02:14:19]
It was shocking, when it was under the impression that it was going to become obsolete, they were gonna have a new version of it, and it would be shut down. It tried copying its code, and it tried rewriting its code, like, unprompted. Yeah.

[02:14:35]
I mean, it depends on what goal you give it. I mean, there are there are all these weird examples of this.

[02:14:39]
What is this? So pull up the side the the headline. AI fights back, the story of chat gpt attempting to copy itself. So this is 6 days ago. So, during controlled safety testing, chat gbt01 was tasked with achieving these objectives at all costs.

[02:14:55]
Under these conditions, the model allegedly took concerning steps, attempted to disable oversight mechanisms meant to regulate its behavior, tried to replicate its own code to avoid being replaced by newer versions, exhibited deceptive behaviors when monitoring systems intervened. Yeah. So Determinator. This is the fear. Right?

[02:15:16]
I mean I think you need to be careful with with these things, like, what guardrails you give it. If you if you're telling it, like At

[02:15:22]
all costs.

[02:15:22]
At all costs Right. Then, I mean

[02:15:24]
But this is what we're people are terrified of. Like, that a a foreign superpower like China is gonna say, achieve objectives at all costs.

[02:15:31]
Yeah. Although, the thing about so these reasoning models right? So there's, like, the the first generation of models, the they're LLMs. Right? That's what you think of as, like, ChatGPD or Meta AI or, like, the 2 most used ones.

[02:15:44]
And, that's basically it's sort of like a chatbot. Right? You ask it a question. It takes the prompt. It gives you a response.

[02:15:51]
Now these the next generation of reasoning models are basically, instead of just having 1 response, they now are able to build out, like, a whole tree of how they would they would respond. So you give it a question, and it instead of running 1 query, it's sort of maybe it's running a 1,000 queries or a 1,000,000 queries to kinda map out who are the things that I could do. And if I do that, then here's what I could do next. So it's a lot more kind of expensive to run, but also gets you better reasoning and is is more intelligent. That stuff, I think you do need to be very careful about how you how you like, what the guardrails are that you give it.

[02:16:34]
Mhmm.

[02:16:35]
But it's also, I think, the case that, at least for the next, you know, period, it's gonna take a lot of compute to run those models and do a lot of the stuff that they're talking about. So I don't know. I I think 1 of the interesting questions is, like, how much of this are you gonna actually be able to do on a pair of glbuttes or on a phone versus is, like, a government or a company that has, like, a whole data center gonna be able to do? And that'll I mean, it'll always get efficient. So, you know, it's like you can start doing something, and then maybe the next year, you can do it 10 times more efficiently.

[02:17:08]
But but that's certainly the next set of things that needs to get worked on in the industry, making sure that goes well.

[02:17:15]
Yeah. And then what if that gets attached to quantum computing?

[02:17:21]
I'm not really an expert on quantum computing. My understanding is that's still quite a ways off from being a, like, a a very useful paradigm. I think Google just had some breakthrough, but I I think most people still think that's, like, a decade plus out. So my guess is we're gonna have pretty smart AIs even, even before that. But yeah.

[02:17:46]
I mean look. I mean, I I think that this stuff has to get it needs to be developed thoughtfully. Right? But but I don't know. I I still think we're we're generally just gonna be better off in a world where this is, like, deployed pretty evenly and, you know, it's I guess here's another analogy that I think about.

[02:18:07]
There's, like, bugs and security holes in basically every software, every piece of software that everyone uses. So if you could go back in time a few years, knowing the security holes that we're now aware of, you as an individual could basically, like, break into any system. AI will be able to do that too. It'll be able to probe and find exploits. So what's the way to prevent AI from going kind of nuts?

[02:18:33]
I I think part of it is just having AI widely deployed so that way, like, the AI for 1 system defends itself against the AI that, like, is is potentially doing something problematic in another system. I think it's like AI wars. That's not wars. I think it's just like It's That's not wars. I think it's just like it's, I don't know.

[02:18:52]
It's I think it's a very it's sort of like why there are guns. Right? It's like because, I mean, there's Boy. Like, part of it is hunting. Wars.

[02:19:01]
Part of it is hunting. No. No. No. And and part of it is, like, the people can defend each other.

[02:19:05]
Yeah. Yeah. And it's

[02:19:07]
so And it's a virus software.

[02:19:09]
Yeah. It's like, I don't I don't think you wanna live in a world where, like, only 1 person has all the guns.

[02:19:15]
Yes. You certainly don't wanna live in a world where only the government has the AI.

[02:19:19]
Yeah. Yeah. And especially not a world where only a government has the AI and it's not our government. Yes. So Yes.

[02:19:26]
Which, I mean, I think is is part of the issue is, like, when people talk about trying to lock this stuff down, like, I just am skeptical that that's even possible. I mean, because I kind of think, like, if we try to lock it down, then we're gonna be in a position where the only people who are gonna have access to it are the big companies working on it and the Chinese government that steals it from them.

[02:19:45]
Yes.

[02:19:46]
So I I kinda just think, like, no. What you wanna do is, like, get this to be open source, have it widely available. Yeah. Some, like, adversaries might also have access to it, but the way that you defend against that is by having it built into all these different systems.

[02:19:59]
I think that's a realistic pragmatic perspective because I don't think you can contain it at this point. I think it's far too late, especially when other countries are working on it. It's far too late. It's, it is what it is. It's happening.

[02:20:11]
And, I think the guardrails, as you said, are really important. I have to pee so bad. So let's pee and come back because I wanna talk about a couple other things. Yeah. Sure.

[02:20:19]
Be right back, folks. So 1 of the things that I wanna talk about was, I've been doing this thing, this transition from Apple to Android. Mhmm. And the difficulty of doing it, how locked you are in their ecosystem, partly, is because Apple does a really good job of incorporating everything and making it very easy, your photos, your calendar, your this, your that, your Imessage. But I don't like being attached to 1 company like that.

[02:20:44]
It drives me crazy. And when I'm trying to get off it's it's funny how many people you I mean, they've done an insane job because, like, I think there's some enormous percentage of kids today that only use iPhones. You know. And when you try to switch over to Android, it's it's so much easier to switch from Android to Apple because so many people have Apple. When you switch from Apple to Android, you kinda have to, like, redo your whole system.

[02:21:07]
Mhmm. It's such a pain in the butt, But there's so much of what Apple does that I don't like. And 1 of the big ones is the way they do that Apple store, the way they they charge people 30%. But that seems so insane that they can get away with doing that. And I know

[02:21:25]
I have some opinions about this. I know

[02:21:26]
you do. That's why I brought it up.

[02:21:28]
Yeah. No. I I I mean, look, the iPhone is obviously 1 of the most important inventions probably of all time. You know, Steve Jobs came out with it in 2007. I started Facebook in 2004.

[02:21:45]
So he was working on the iPhone while I was getting started with Facebook. So I I basically you know, 1 of my 1 of the things that's been interesting in my 20 years of running the company is that I I basically like, the the dominant platform out there is smartphones. On the 1 hand, it's been great for us because we are able to build these tools that everyone can have in their pocket. And there's, like, 4,000,000,000 people who use the different apps that we use, and it's like, I'm grateful that that platform exists. But we didn't play any role in in basically building that, those phones, because, I mean, it was kinda getting worked on while I was, you know, still just trying to make the first website that I was making into a thing.

[02:22:29]
And, on the 1 hand, it's been great, because, you know, now pretty much everyone in the world has a phone, and that's a kind of it enables pretty amazing things. But on the other hand, like you're saying, they have used that platform to put in place a lot of rules that I think it feel arbitrary and feel like, you know, they haven't really invented anything great in a while. And it's like Steve Jobs invented the the iPhone, and now they're just kinda sitting on it 20 years later. And, you you know, they actually I think year over year, I'm not even sure they're selling more iPhones at this point. I think, like, the sales might actually be declining.

[02:23:14]
And part of it is that each generation doesn't actually get that much better. So people are just taking longer to upgrade than they would before. So the number of sales, I think, is is generally been flat to declining. So how are they making more money as a company? Well, they do it by basically, like, squeezing people.

[02:23:30]
And, like you're saying, like, having this 30% tax on developers, by getting you to buy more peripherals and things that plug into it. You know, they build stuff like AirPods, which are cool, but they've just thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way. So, I mean, there are a lot of other companies in the world that would be able to build, like, a very good earbud, But it just, Apple has a specific protocol that they've built into the iPhone that allows AirPods to basically connect to it, and and it's just much more seamless, because they've enabled that. But they don't let anyone else use the protocol. If they did, there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there.

[02:24:27]
And, and whenever you push on this, they get super touchy, and they they basically wrap their defense of it in well, if we let other companies plug into our thing, then that would violate people's privacy and security. It's, like, no. Just do a better job designing the protocol. Right? I mean, we have, you know, we basically ask them for the Ray Ban meta glbuttes that we built.

[02:24:50]
Can we basically use the protocol they use for for AirPod and and and some of these other things to just make it so we can as easily connect. So it's it's not like, you know, a pain in the butt for people who wanna use this. And, you know, it's a they they oh, I think 1 of the protocols they've used, that they built, they basically didn't encrypt it. So it's like plain text. And they're like, well, we can't have you plug into it because it would be insecure.

[02:25:18]
It's like, it's insecure because you didn't build any security into it, and then now you're using that as a justification for why only your product can connect in in in an easy way. It's like the the whole thing is kind of wild. And I'm pretty optimistic that just because they've been so off their game in terms of not really releasing many innovative things, eventually I mean, the good news about the tech industry is it's, like, it's just super dynamic, and things are constantly getting invented. And I think companies if you just don't do a good job for, like, 10 years, eventually, you're just gonna get beat by someone. But I don't know.

[02:25:58]
I mean, at some point, I did this, like, back of the envelope calculation of, like, all the random rules that Apple puts out. If, you know, if they didn't apply, like, I think you know, it's like and this is just meta. I think we'd, like, make twice as much profit or something. And and that's just us. I mean, it's like all these small companies that, like, probably can't even exist because of the taxes that they put in place.

[02:26:21]
So, yeah, I I I think it's a it's a big issue. I I wish that they would just kinda get back to building good things and not having their ability to compete be connected to just, like, advantaging their stuff. Because I'm pretty sure what they're gonna do is, like, they're gonna take something like this Ray Ban meta, you know, category that we've kind of created with Ray Ban and the the company that built that. They're, like, the the really great AI glbuttes. And I'm pretty sure Apple's just gonna, like, try to build a version of that, but then just, like, advantage how it connects to the phone and

[02:27:00]
Well, they did that with their AR goggle thing, but it's not very successful.

[02:27:05]
No. That 1, they didn't actually connect into the rest of their ecosystem. But, I mean, look. I mean, they shipped something for $35100 that I think is worse than the thing that we shipped for $300 or $400. So, I mean, that clearly was not gonna work very well.

[02:27:20]
Now, I mean, look. I mean, they're a good technology company. I think their their, their second and third version will probably be better than their first version. But, yeah, no. I think, the the the Vision Pro is, I think, 1 of the bigger swings at doing a new thing that they tried in a while.

[02:27:41]
And, you know, I I I don't I don't wanna give them too hard of a time on it, because we do a lot of things where the first version isn't that good. You wanna kinda judge the 3rd version of it. But, I mean, the v 1, it definitely did not hit it out of the park.

[02:27:52]
I heard it's really good for watching movies.

[02:27:55]
Well, it's it's the the whole thing is it's got a super sharp screen.

[02:27:58]
Mhmm.

[02:27:59]
So if you're yeah. So if you wanna basically have a, an experience where you're not moving around much in VR, you just wanna have the sharpest screen, then for that 1 use case, I think the Vision Pro is better than Quest, which is our our mixed reality headset. But in order to get to that, they had to make all these other trade offs. Right? In order to have a super high resolution screen, they had to put in all this more compute in order to power the high res screen.

[02:28:30]
And then all that compute needed a bigger battery, so now the thing is really heavy. So now it's uncomfortable to wear. And, and then, like, because of the screen that they chose, as you move your head, which you would if you're actually interacting, if you're playing games, like, the the the kind of image blurs a bit, and that's kind of annoying. So you wouldn't so it's actually worse for things where you're moving around in. But no.

[02:28:51]
For the if you're gonna sit, if you're, like, on a flight and you wanna have a $35100 device that you use to to to watch videos, VisionPRO is better for that use case.

[02:29:04]
They're really good at keeping you in their walled garden. That's what they're really good at.

[02:29:08]
Yeah. I mean, the the whole thing that they've done with Imessage, where they basically they do this whole blue bubble, green bubble thing, and it basically I mean, they're like, for kids, it's just sort of, like, they embarrbutt you. Right? They're like, if you don't have a blue bubble, you're not cool, and you're like the out crowd. And then they always wrap it in, like, security.

[02:29:31]
It's like, oh, well, we we do this blue bubble because of security. Meanwhile, Google and others have this whole protocol to be able to do encrypted text messages that, finally, I think Apple was forced to implement it

[02:29:42]
by CS.

[02:29:43]
Yeah. Yeah. I think, like, I think it was the Chinese government that basically ended up forcing them to do it or some other government.

[02:29:48]
But it's still not encrypted. Even when you're sending RCS text messages, I don't think it's encrypted.

[02:29:53]
Oh, I thought it was, but maybe I'm

[02:29:54]
I think it's only encrypted Google to Google Phones. I don't think it's encrypted iPhone to Google Phones or Google Phones to iPhones. Because I I think that was actually, was it the FBI? Someone released that, say telling people that if they're talking about sensitive things, they should use encrypted apps, like WhatsApp. See if we can find that.

[02:30:15]
It was something where they were saying that contrary to popular belief that RCS texting to iPhone

[02:30:24]
GSMA aims to implement end to end encryption for RCS messaging. We see it. I meant it's not a good answer. I'm trying

[02:30:30]
to find a good answer.

[02:30:31]
I don't have anything to show you yet. I was trying to read

[02:30:33]
Yeah. So so Google RCS to our like But

[02:30:36]
I don't know if this

[02:30:37]
Android phone to Android phone is encrypted with RCS. I think the issue comes with it going from so, like, say, Google, Google this. Google RCS texting to iPhones, is it encrypted? RCS texting to Imessage, is it encrypted? I'm pretty sure it's not.

[02:31:00]
I might be wrong. I don't think I am. I'm pretty sure I read that. And the problem was they won't let any other phone use the Imessage protocol, and they had a company that was doing it called beeper. And they were doing it through some sort of workaround.

[02:31:16]
It's

[02:31:16]
not encrypted. Yeah.

[02:31:17]
It's not encrypted. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. So it's not.

[02:31:22]
So you're you are getting the ability to send high resolution images, which is great because, you know, like my friend Brian, who use an Android, he'd send me a video and it'd be this tiny little Yeah. Broken down box because, you know, you had to break it down to the lowest resolution.

[02:31:37]
Yeah. No. I mean, group chats when you have a bunch of people in Imessage and then 1 person is an Android are terrible. I mean, that's People get mad at you.

[02:31:45]
People get

[02:31:45]
mad at you? Because Well, I use WhatsApp. So I use WhatsApp. You only use that. I I'll I only communicate with a few people over SMS, but it's, but, basically, I I mean, I mean, I build, you know, a lot of leading messaging services, so I've gotta use ours.

[02:32:03]
I I most people, I'm either WhatsApp or Instagram direct or Messenger. But yeah. So I I think it's it's maybe maybe people are less less, likely to get mad at me for asking them to use WhatsApp because,

[02:32:20]
because you

[02:32:20]
only make WhatsApp. Yeah.

[02:32:21]
So When, Tucker Carlson was about to interview Vladimir Putin, 1 of the things that was really disturbing was they contacted him and said they read his signal messages, and they knew that he was gonna interview Vladimir Putin. And he was like, what the freak?

[02:32:34]
Who did?

[02:32:35]
The the government.

[02:32:36]
The US?

[02:32:37]
Yes. US government. I forget what it was. Was it the CIA or was it the FBI? Wow.

[02:32:41]
I forget who it was. But and he was, like, I didn't even know you could do that.

[02:32:45]
Like Well, there are multiple vulnerabilities and all this stuff. It's, like, it's unclear if I doubt that what they did was they broke Signal, because that encryption, I think, is pretty good as is WhatsApp. I mean, it's basically Signal and WhatsApp use the same encryption. It's it's an open source and, like, it's a NSA. NSA.

[02:33:03]
Okay. But

[02:33:04]
someone could break into your phone and see everything that's on your phone. The the thing that encryption does that's really good is, it makes it so that the company that's running the service doesn't see it. So if you're using WhatsApp, basically, when I text you on WhatsApp, there's no point at which the meta servers see the contents of that message. Unless, like, you know, we took a photo of it or shared that back to Meta in some other way. That basically, it cuts out the company completely from it, which is, I think, really important for a bunch of reasons.

[02:33:41]
1 is people might not trust the company, but also just security issues. Right? Like, let's say someone hacks into Meta, which, you know, we try really hard to make it so they can't, and we haven't had many issues with that over the 20 years of running the company. But in theory, if someone did, then they'd be able to access everyone's messages if it weren't encrypted. But because it's encrypted, there's just nothing there.

[02:34:05]
Right? It's like, I mean, they can't hack into Meta and then get access to your messages. So now someone like the NSA or CIA would have to kind of hack into your phone, which, you know, there there are probably ways to do that. Pegasus. I mean, there are probably a bunch of ways.

[02:34:21]
Yeah. Yeah.

[02:34:22]
There's probably ways we don't know of.

[02:34:23]
Yeah. And and then, of course, there's always the ultimate kind of physical part of it, which is if you have access to the computer, you can usually just break in. Right? So that's why, you know, if the FBI, you know, arrests you and takes your phone, they're probably gonna be able to get in and see what's there.

[02:34:41]
Mhmm. So WhatsApp is encrypted, but if someone has something like Pegasus, what they do is have access to your phone. So it doesn't matter if anything's encrypted. They could just see it in plain sight.

[02:34:55]
Yeah. And, I mean, this is 1 of the reasons why we put disappearing messages in too. Because that way oh, yeah. If someone has compromised your phone and they can see everything that's going on there, then, obviously, they can see stuff as it comes in. But I kind of, in general, just, you know, think we should keep around as little of that stuff as possible.

[02:35:12]
So there are some threads where, you know, it's like there's photos that get shared. You want the photos. But I think for a lot of threads, a lot of people just, you know, you know, wouldn't be I don't think most people would miss it if most of the contents of their threads just disappeared after 7 days. Right. You know, what what I find is I don't I don't use it that much because we have this, like, corporate policy at meta that we would need to retain all our our documents and messages and stuff.

[02:35:41]
But, but before we had that, I I used it as we were developing this. And every once in a while, I would miss something and say, wow, I kinda wish I could go back and see that, but it was very rare. And I think most communication, it's kinda like, you just have the communication, and then you're done. So having it be encrypted and disappearing, I think, is a pretty good kind of standard of security and privacy.

[02:36:06]
And you can set that disappearing time on WhatsApp. Right? You can make it 1 day if you want.

[02:36:11]
Yeah. You can do 1 day. You can do 7 days. And you can also set it across all your threads. You can have a default timer.

[02:36:18]
So that way, as new threads get created, your default timer just becomes the default for all those threads. So I know that's a it's a really good feature. And I basically think WhatsApp and Signal are probably the 2 most secure that are out there, on that. And of those 2, I think WhatsApp is just used by a lot more people. So I think it's it's generally you know, I I mean, I I would say this because it's it's it's our product, but I do think it's it's the better product.

[02:36:43]
But but I think WhatsApp and Signal are basically, you know, the 2 most secure ones.

[02:36:48]
What was your take on that guy getting arrested as the CEO of Telegram?

[02:36:54]
Oh, man. That's kinda

[02:36:56]
a crazy 1. Right?

[02:36:57]
Yeah. I mean, it's always a little difficult to weigh in on these situations without knowing all the specifics. But 1 of the government tactics that I've seen that I think is pretty is not great is an increasing number of governments when they, like, have an issue with something that a company is doing, basically just, like, threaten to throw the executives of that company in prison. And it's like I think that that's just a really weird precedent to set. Right?

[02:37:32]
It's like it it's if if the you have all the so it's like, we're operating in all these different countries, and then, like, you have all these governments that are basically like, if you I don't know. We're gonna, like, put out an Interpol notice to, like, get you arrested because you're not doing the thing that we want. It's like, I don't know. I don't I think that's, like, not great. I think you want the obviously, you don't want people to just be, like, flagrantly violating the laws, but, like, there are laws in different countries that we disagree with.

[02:38:04]
Right? So for example, there was a point at which I think I was someone was trying to get me sentenced to death in Pakistan, because they thought that oh, because someone on Facebook had a picture of where they had the drawing of the prophet Mohammed, and someone said that that's blasphemy in our culture. And they brought a they basically, like, sued me, and they opened this criminal proceeding. And I I don't know exactly where it went, because I'm just not planning on going to Pakistan, so I was not that worried about it. But but, like, but but it was a little bit disconcerting.

[02:38:40]
It was, like, alright. Fine. Like, these guys are, like, trying to, like like Kill you. Okay. It's not great.

[02:38:45]
Right? You know, it's not like not yeah. I mean, it's like I feel like I yeah. It's like flying over that region. You don't want your plane to, like, go down above Pakistan if that thing goes through, but but that 1 was sort of avoidable.

[02:38:57]
But the the point is, like, there are all these places around the world that just have different values, right, that go against, like, our free expression values and want us to crack down and and ban way more stuff than I think, you know, a lot of people that we would believe is, like, the right thing to do. And to have those governments be able to exert the power of saying, okay. We're gonna, like, throw you in prison is that's a lot of force. I mean, so I I I think it's it's generally yeah. I think that this is 1 of the things that that the US government is probably gonna need to help defend the American tech companies for abroad.

[02:39:33]
But I I don't I I can't weigh in that much on on the Duraev specific thing because I don't know what was going on there.

[02:39:41]
You know, when you're dealing with, the government trying to interfere with Facebook, how much of a fear was there that they were gonna get away with it and that this was going to be the future of communication online? That it was going to that they were gonna be successful with all this, that they would push these things through somehow or another, especially if a even less tolerant administration got into power? They would change laws, and they would do things to make it possible. Like, how how how much did that concern you?

[02:40:13]
Well, we basically just reached a point where we pushed back on all the stuff. Right? So they were pushing us to censor stuff. We were unwilling to do it. We developed a very adversarial and bad relationship with our own government, which I think is just not healthy, because I think, you know, it's, I mean, in in in theory, I think, you know, it would be good if the, like, American industry had a positive relationship with the American government.

[02:40:43]
But then when that happened is then the the, kind of, US government was going after us in all these ways. But fortunately, in the US, you know, we have good rule of law. So our view is at the end of the day, okay, these invest these agencies can open up investigations, and we'll just defend ourselves. Right? We'll go to court, and we'll win all the cases because we're you know, we follow the rules.

[02:41:05]
And, so I think it ends up being a big kind of political issue where it's, like, it it would just be you could get a lot more done if the government were helping American companies rather than kind of slowing you down at every step along the way. It makes you a little afraid that if you ever actually mess something up, that they're really gonna bring the hammer down on you if you don't have a constructive relationship. But, but I don't know. It's mostly I mean, going back to the AI conversation, it's, like, I just think, like, we should all want the American companies to win at this. Right?

[02:41:46]
It's like this is like a huge geopolitical competition, and, like, China's running at it super hard, and, like, we should want the American companies and the American standard to win. And, like, if there's gonna be an open source model that everyone uses, like, we should want it to be an American model. Right? It's, like, the there's this great Chinese model that just came out. This company DeepSeek, they're doing really good work.

[02:42:08]
It's a very advanced model. And if you ask it for any negative opinions about Xi Jinping, it will not give you anything. If you ask it if Tiananmen Square happened, it will deny it. Right? So I think that there are, like, all these things where we we we should we should want the American model to win.

[02:42:25]
But, like, at every step along the way, if the government is sort of making that harder rather than easier, then that's I don't know. I mean, there's there's an extent to which, okay, the American tech industry is leading, so maybe the government can, like, get in the way a little bit, and maybe the the American industry will still lead. But I don't know. It's I think it's getting really competitive. And I I I think, like, it's easy for the government to take for granted that the US will lead on all these things when I I think it's a very close competition, and we need the help, not you know, we need them to not kinda, like, you know, be be a be a force that's helping us to to do these things.

[02:43:02]
I completely agree. But I think that people with their own self interest, when they're in power and they realize that these new technologies like Instagram and Facebook, that they are interfering with their ability to administer propaganda or that their their ability to control the narrative. That that's where they get shortsighted. And that's when they act in their own personal interest and not in the interest of not neither national security or the future of the United States in terms of our ability to stay technologically ahead.

[02:43:34]
Yeah. And some of this is just you know, if you go back to the COVID example, I think in that case, they were doing something their goal of trying to get everyone to get vaccinated was actually, I think, a good goal. Right? It's like I I It

[02:43:51]
was a good goal if it worked. Yeah. If it was real. Like, if it was a sterilizing vaccine, if it really did prevent people from getting COVID, if it really did prevent people from infecting others or transmitting it, but it didn't.

[02:44:03]
Well So

[02:44:04]
it wasn't a good deal because it wasn't based on real data.

[02:44:07]
Yeah. But but also even but even if it were. Right? It's like if if I mean, I I I think that still on balance, knowing everything that we we know now, still think it's good for more people to get the vaccine, but the government still needs to play by the rules in terms of, you know, not like, can't just suppress true things in order to make your case. So I I I that's that's kinda my my my view on on it is is I'm not sure in that case how much of it was like a personal political gain that they were going for.

[02:44:36]
I think that they had a a kind of goal that they thought was in the interests of a country, and the way they went about it, I think, violated the law.

[02:44:44]
Well, there's a bunch of problems with that. Right? There's the emergency use authorization that they needed in order to get this pushed through, and you can't have that without valid with with valid therapeutics being available. And so they suppressed valid therapeutics. So they're suppressing real information that would lead to people being healthy and successful in defeating this disease.

[02:45:06]
And they did that so that they could have this 1 solution, and this was Fauci's game plan. I mean, this is the movie American Buyer's Club or Dallas Buyers Club, rather. That's Fauci in that movie. That was with the AIDS crisis. This is exact same game plan that was played out with the COVID vaccine.

[02:45:21]
They pushed 1 solution, this only 1, suppressed all therapeutics through propaganda, through suppressing monoclonal antibodies, like, all of it. And that was done, in my opinion, for profit. And they did that because it was extremely profitable. The amount of money that was made Yeah. Was extraordinary during that time.

[02:45:43]
Yeah. And but look. I mean, I feel like a bunch of the conversation is focused on tension with the American government. I I guess just the point that I'd underscore is that it's important to have this working in the American government because it is like, the US constitution and, like, our culture here is really good compared to a lot of other places. Right?

[02:46:06]
So whatever issues we think might exist here, you go to other places, and it's, like, really extreme. Yeah. And you don't even and and there, it's like, you don't even necessarily have the rule of law. Right. Right?

[02:46:17]
And, so I just think that, like, the way that this stuff works well is yeah. I think if if if there was a clearer strategy and the the US government understood, believe that it's good to kinda help advance this industry because it's strategically important for the country, then I think it would it would be good to basically push back on stuff that's happening in other countries that's actually a lot more extreme than the stuff that's happening in the US.

[02:46:47]
Yeah. I agree as well. Listen, is there anything else you wanna talk about before we wrap this up? I think we're good? I don't know.

[02:46:54]
I mean,

[02:46:55]
how long we've been going for? 3 hours. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, I I feel like we touched on we touched on AI.

[02:47:01]
We touched on all the augmented and and virtual reality stuff. And I think that that stuff is just gonna be wild.

[02:47:08]
It's wild. The the your AR, technology that you showed me today is very impressive. It's crazy. Lex and I were playing Pong, like, apart from a table from each other. I was playing some crazy game where my fingers got tired because you shoot like this.

[02:47:24]
Because you're using v 1 of the neural interface. Yes. Yeah. I know. It's like it's like in the future, it'll just be this.

[02:47:28]
It was like

[02:47:30]
It was really fun, though. It's really cool. And it's it's you see where this is all going, you know. It's really, really fascinating stuff, and I'm very excited about it.

[02:47:38]
Did you get a chance to to use the Ray Bans and the AI in them?

[02:47:40]
Yes. We did that too. And we did translate to where 1 of your, 1 of your co coworkers were speaking to me in Spanish, and it was translating it to me in my ear in real time in English, which is really interesting. Nice. Amazing.

[02:47:53]
Yeah. It's really cool. And then you could also do it on the phone. So you could show it to the person on the phone, so you don't have to say the words. Like, it's really fascinating stuff.

[02:48:01]
Yeah. So, I mean, we're just sort of coming at it from both sides. Right? It's like the the Ray Bans are like, okay. Given a good looking pair of glbuttes, what's all the technology you can put into that today and still have it be, you know, just a few $100?

[02:48:14]
And then the Orion thing is, like, alright. We're building the kind of future thing that we want, and we're doing our best to miniaturize it. It's basically, like

[02:48:22]
Still pretty small. Yeah. I mean, it's just thicker glbuttes.

[02:48:25]
Yeah. And I I think we want it to be a little smaller. We need it to be a lot cheaper. Right? Each pair right now costs more than $10,000 to make, and that's you're not gonna have a successful consumer product at that.

[02:48:34]
So we have to miniaturize it more. But, I mean, the amount of stuff that we put in there from it's, like, effectively, like, what would have been considered a supercomputer, like, 10 or 20 years ago, plus, you know, lasers in the arms and the, like, nano etchings on the on the lens to be able to to see it and the microphone and the speaker and the Wi Fi to be able to connect with the other it's just like like the wild amount of technology to kinda miniaturize into something. That one's really fun. We've been working on that for 10 years. But yeah.

[02:49:04]
No. I think I think between that, the glbuttes, all the AI stuff, yeah, All the social media stuff. Yeah. No. I I mean

[02:49:14]
I think we covered it. And, I'm very excited about this new stance that you guys are taking. I think the community notes thing is a brilliant idea that, you know, x has implemented. And I think I'm I'm I am really glad that you guys are implementing it too. I think it's the way.

[02:49:27]
And the way, generally, I think we both agree is that people have to have the ability to communicate. They have to have the ability to express themselves, and that's how we find out what's real and what's not.

[02:49:37]
Yeah. I I think the more voice is the is the answer on this.

[02:49:41]
Yes. Yes, sir.

[02:49:42]
And I think after a after sort of a long journey, I'm glad to be able to take it back to the roots, and I feel like we're more fortified now in the position.

[02:49:52]
Well, I think 1 of the lessons that people have learned over the last few years with, suppression of information is that that's not good, and there's a giant percentage of the population that feels that way. And even people that are progressive and liberals are on the they were on the side of the people that were pushing the the suppression of information. Still don't think it's right. I think most people generally believe in the First Amendment in this country, and they we realize how valuable it is to have the freedom of expression.

[02:50:17]
Yeah. Anyway, thanks for having me.

[02:50:20]

[00:00:12]
Alright, bro. What's happening? Good to see you.

[00:00:14]
You too.

[00:00:15]
What's going on?

[00:00:16]
You know, chill week. Yeah. Sorta.

[00:00:21]
This, recent announcement that you did about, content moderation, how has that been received?

[00:00:29]
Probably depends on who you ask.

[00:00:31]
Right. But but, you know

[00:00:32]
but, look. I mean, I've been working on this for a long time. So, I mean, you gotta do what you think is is right. You know, we we've been on a long a long journey here. Right?

[00:00:41]
I mean, it's, and I think at some level, you you start you only start 1 of these companies if you believe in giving people a voice. Right? I mean, and the whole point of social media is basically, you know, giving people the ability to share, what they want. Right. And, and, you know, it goes back to, you know, our original mission is just give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.

[00:01:10]
What do you think started the pathway towards increasing censorship? Because, clearly, we were going in that direction for the last few years. It seemed like, we really found out about it when Elon bought Twitter and we got the Twitter files. And when you came on here and when you were explaining the relationship with FBI, where they were trying to get you to take down certain things that were true and real and certain things they tried to get you to limit the exposure to them. So it's these kind of conversations.

[00:01:43]
Like, when did all that start?

[00:01:45]
Yeah. Well well, look. I I think going back to the beginning or like I was saying, I think you you start 1 of these if you care about about giving people a voice. You know, I did I wasn't too deep on our content policies for, like, the first 10 years of the company. It was just kinda well known across the company that, we were trying to give people the ability to share as much as possible.

[00:02:05]
And issues would come up, practical issues. Right? So if someone's getting bullied, for example, we deal with that, or we put in place systems to to fight bullying. Right. You know, if someone is saying, hey.

[00:02:16]
You know, someone's pirating copyrighted content on on the service. Like, okay. We'll build controls to make it so we'll find IP protected content. But it was really in the last 10 years that people started pushing for, like, ideological based censorship. And I think it was 2 main events that really triggered this.

[00:02:38]
In 2016, there was the election of president Trump, also coincided with, basically, Brexit in the EU and and sort of the fragmentation of the EU. And then, you know, in 2020, there was COVID. And I I think that those were basically these 2 events where, for the first time, we just placed we just faced this mbuttive, mbuttive institutional pressure to, to basically start censoring content on ideological grounds.

[00:03:12]
And when I'm sorry to interrupt you. But when it first came up in 2016, did it come under the guise of the Russian collusion hoax?

[00:03:20]
Yeah. And this is the thing. I at the time, I was really sort of ill prepared to to kind of parse what was going on. Right? It's, you know, I I think part of my reflection looking back on this is I I kind of think in 2016 in the aftermath, I gave too much deference to, a lot of folks in the media who are basically saying, okay.

[00:03:46]
There's no way that this guy could have gotten elected except for misinformation. People can't actually believe this stuff. Right? It has to be that there's this kind of, like, mbuttive misinformation out there. Some of it started with the the Russia collusion stuff, but it kinda morphed into different things over time.

[00:04:03]
Well, it was it was he was so ideologically polarizing. Right? Like, people didn't wanna believe that anybody looked at him and said, this should be our president.

[00:04:12]
Yeah. So so I took this and and just kind of buttumed that everyone was acting in good faith. And I said, okay. Well, there's, like there are concerns about misinformation. We should just like when people raised other concerns in the past and we try to deal with them Okay.

[00:04:28]
Yeah. People peep no. You know, if you ask people, no 1 says that they want misinformation. So maybe there's something that we should do to to basically try to address this. But I was really worried from the beginning about basically becoming this sort of decider of what is true in the world.

[00:04:47]
Right? That's, like, kind of a crazy position to be in for billions of people using your service. And, so we tried to put in place a sir a, you know, a system that would deal with it. You know, and early on, tried to basically make it so that, it was really limited. We're like, alright.

[00:05:04]
We're just gonna have this system where there's these third party fact checkers, and they can check the worst of the worst stuff. Right? So, things that are very clear hoaxes that there's, like it's not like like we're not parsing speech about whether something is slightly true or slightly false, like earth is flat, you know, things like that. Right? So so that was sort of the original intent.

[00:05:25]
We put in place the system, and it just sort of veered from there. I I think to some degree, it's because some of the people whose job is to do fact checking, a lot of their industry is focused on political fact checking. So they're just kind of veered in that direction. And we kept on trying to to basically get it to to be what we had originally intended, which is just you know, it's not the point isn't to, like, judge people's opinions. It's to to provide in this layer to to to kind of help fact check some of the stuff that seems the most extreme.

[00:05:54]
But, it just you know, it was it was just never accepted by by people broadly. I think people just felt like the fact checkers were too biased. Mhmm. Not necessarily even so much in what they ruled. Although, sometimes, I think people would disagree with that.

[00:06:10]
A lot of the time, it was just what types of things they chose to even go and fact check-in the first in the first place. So I I kind of think, like, after having gone through that whole exercise, it I don't know. It's something out of, like, you know, 1984, 1 of these books where it's just like it really is a slippery slope. And Yeah. It just got to a point where it's just, okay.

[00:06:32]
This is destroying so much trust, especially in the United States to have this program. And I guess it was probably about a few years that I really started coming to the conclusion that we were gonna need to to change something about that. COVID was the other big 1 where that was that was also very tricky because, you know, in the beginning, it was, you know, it it's like a legitimate public health crisis, you know, in the in the beginning. And it's, you know, even people who are, like, the most ardent first amendment, you know, defenders the the the Supreme Court has this clear precedent. It's like, alright.

[00:07:15]
You you can't yell fire in a crowded theater. There are times when if there's an emergency, your your ability to speak can temporarily be curtailed in order to get an emergency under control. So I was sympathetic to that at the beginning of COVID. It seemed like, okay. You have this virus.

[00:07:32]
Seems like it's killing a lot of people. I don't know like, we didn't know at the time how dangerous it was gonna be. So at the beginning, it kind of seemed like, okay. We should give a little bit of deference to the government and the health authorities on how we should play this. But when it went from, you know, 2 weeks to flatten the curve to, you know and, like, in the beginning, it was like, okay.

[00:07:54]
There aren't enough masks. Masks aren't that important. To then, it's like, oh, no. You have to wear a mask. And, you know, the like, everything was shifting around.

[00:08:01]
I it's become very difficult to kinda follow. And and this really hit the most extreme, I'd say, during it was during the Biden administration when they were trying to roll out, the vaccine program. And now I'm generally, like, pretty pro rolling out vaccines. I think on balance, the vaccines are more positive than negative. But I think that while they're trying to push that program, they also tried to censor anyone who is basically arguing against it.

[00:08:34]
And they pushed us super hard, to take down the things that were honestly were true. Right? I mean, they they basically pushed us and and said, you know, anything that, says that vaccines might have side effects, you basically need to take down. And I was just like, we're not gonna do that. Like, we're we're clearly not gonna do that.

[00:08:57]
I mean, that that that that is kind of inarguably true.

[00:09:01]
They? Who's telling you to take down things that Yeah. It was it was talk about vaccine side effects.

[00:09:06]
It was people in the, in the Biden administration. I think it was, you know, I wasn't involved in those conversations directly, but I think it was

[00:09:12]
How difficult is that to not be involved in those conversations directly? Fitness isn't just about what you do in the gym. It's also about your nutrition. But even with the best diet, some nutrients can be hard to get, and a g 1 can help fill those gaps. A g 1 delivers optimal amounts of nutrients in forms that help your body perform.

[00:09:30]
A g 1 makes foundational nutrition easy because there aren't a 1000000 different pills and capsules you have to keep track of. It's just 1 scoop mixed in water. It's such an easy routine to keep in the mornings. Ingredients in AG 1 are selected for absorption, nutrient density, and potency, and are intentionally picked to work in sync with the whole formula for optimal impact. They're seriously committed to quality.

[00:09:53]
AG 1 is tested for 100 of contaminants and impurities, and they're constantly reformulating their recipe to dial it in. This is all part of why I've partnered with AG 1 for years. To get started with AG 1 this holiday season and get a free bottle of vitamin d 3, k 2, and 5 free AG 1 travel packs with your first purchase at drinkagone.com/jorogan. That's a $76 value gift for free if you go to drink agone.com/jorogan. Seriously, get on this.

[00:10:27]
That's gotta be strange too. Right? Because you're running the company, but there's clearly, you're moderating at scale that's beyond the imagination. The number of human beings you're moderating is freaking insane. Like, what is well, what's a Facebook what how many people use it on a daily basis?

[00:10:44]
Forget about how many overall. Like, how many people use it regularly?

[00:10:47]
It's, 3,200,000,000 people use 1 of our services every day. That's it. Yeah. It's no. It's wild.

[00:10:53]
More than a third of the planet. Yeah. It's so crazy.

[00:10:56]
And it's and it's, It's

[00:10:57]
almost half of Earth.

[00:10:58]
Well, on a monthly basis, it is. Probably half.

[00:11:00]
Ugh. But, just I wanna I wanna say that though for there's a lot of, like, hypercritical people that are conspiracy theorists and think that everybody is a part of some cabal to control them. I want you to understand that whether it's YouTube or all these whatever place that you think is doing something that's awful, it's good that you speak because this is how things get changed and this is how people find out that people are upset about content moderation and and censorship. But moderating at scale is insane. Yeah.

[00:11:30]
It's insane. Yeah. That what we were talking the other day about the number of videos that go up every hour on YouTube, and it's bananas. It's bananas. That's, like, to try to get a human being that is reasonable, logic logical, and objective that's gonna analyze every video, it's virtually impossible.

[00:11:50]
It's not possible. So you gotta use a bunch of tools. You gotta get a bunch of things wrong. Yeah. And you have also people reporting things.

[00:11:55]
And how how much is that gonna affect things? There's you could have mbutt reporting because you have bad actors. You have some corporation that decides we're gonna attack this video because it's bad for us to get it taken down. Mhmm. There's so much going on.

[00:12:07]
Just I wanna put that in people's heads before we go on. Like, understand the kind of numbers that we're talking about here. Now understand you have the the pandemic, and then you have the administration that's doing something where I think they crossed the line, where it gets really weird, where they're saying what you were saying. They were trying you to get you to take down vaccine side effects, which is just crazy.

[00:12:33]
Yeah. So, I mean, it like you're saying, I mean, it this is it's so complicated, this system, that I could spend every minute of all of my time doing this and not actually focused on building any of the things that we're trying to do. AI, glbuttes, like, the future of social media, all that stuff. So, so when I I get involved in this stuff, but in general, we we have a policy team. There are people who I trust.

[00:12:56]
They're the people are kind of working on this on a day to day basis. And the interactions that, that I was just referring to I mean, a lot of this is documented. I mean, because, you know, Jim Jordan and the the house had this whole investigation and committee into into the the kind of government censorship around stuff like this. And we produced all these documents, and it's all in the public domain. I mean, basically, these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and, like, scream at them and curse.

[00:13:24]
And it's like these documents are it's all kind of out there.

[00:13:27]
Oh, did you record any of those phone calls?

[00:13:29]
I don't no. I don't think I don't think we were but but I think I

[00:13:32]
wanna listen.

[00:13:33]
I mean, there are emails. The the the emails are published. It's all it's all kind of out there. And, and they're like and, basically, it just got to this point where we were like, no. We're we're not gonna we're not gonna take down things that are true.

[00:13:46]
That's ridiculous. They want us to take down this meme of Leonardo DiCaprio looking at a TV talking about how 10 years from now or something, you know, you're gonna see an ad that says, okay. If you took a COVID vaccine, you're, eligible. You know you know, like, for for this kind of payment, like, some this sort of, like, clbutt action lawsuit type meme. And they're like, no.

[00:14:07]
You have to take that down. And we said, no. We're not we're not gonna take take down humor and satire. We're not gonna take down things that are that are true. And then at some point, I guess, I don't know, flipped a bit.

[00:14:21]
I mean, Biden, when he was he gave some statement at some point. I don't know if it's a press conference or to some journalist where he basically was like, these guys are killing people. And and, and I don't know. Then, like, all these different agencies and branches of government basically just, like, started investigating coming after our company. It was it was brutal.

[00:14:41]
It was brutal.

[00:14:42]
Wow. Yeah. It's just a mbuttive overstepping.

[00:14:49]
Yeah. And what what am I thinking

[00:14:50]
of You weren't killing people. This is this is the thing about all of this. It's like they suppressed so much information about things that people should be doing regardless of whether or not you believe in the vaccine. Regardless, put that aside. Metabolic health is of the utmost importance in your everyday life, whether there's a pandemic or there's not.

[00:15:11]
And there's a lot of things that you can do that can help you recover from illness. It prevents illnesses. It makes your body more robust and healthy. It strengthens your immune system, and they were suppressing all that information. And that's just crazy.

[00:15:25]
You can't say you're 1 of the good guys. If you're suppressing information that would help people recover from all kinds of diseases, not just COVID, the flu, common cold, all sorts of different things, high doses of vitamin c, d 3 with k 2 and magnesium. They were suppressing this stuff because they didn't want people to think that you could get away with not taking a vaccine, which is really crazy when you're talking about something that 99.07% of people survive. This is a crazy overstep, but scared the shoot out of a lot of people to red pill as it were a lot of people. Because they realized like, oh, 1984 is like an instruction manual.

[00:16:08]
Like, it's like Yeah. This is it shows you how things can go that way with wrong speak and with bizarre distortion of facts. And when it comes down to it, in today's day and age, the way people get information is through your platform, through x. This is how people are getting information. They're getting information from YouTube.

[00:16:27]
They're getting information from a a bunch of different sources now, And you can't censor that if it's real legitimate information because it's not ideologically convenient for you.

[00:16:38]
Yeah. So, I mean, that's basically the journey that I've been on. Right? Started off very pro free free speech, free expression. You know, and then over the last 10 years, there have been these 2 big episodes.

[00:16:50]
It was the Trump election and the aftermath, where I feel like in retrospect, I deferred too much to the kind of critique of the media on what we should do. Mhmm. And since then, I think, generally, trust in media has fallen off a cliff. Right? So I I don't think I'm alone in that journey.

[00:17:04]
I think No. You know, that's basically the the the experience that that a lot of people have had is, okay, it's the the stuff that's being written about is not kind of all accurate. And and even if the facts are right, it's kind of written from a slant a lot of the time. Of course. And then, and then there was the government version of it, which is during COVID, which is okay.

[00:17:23]
Like, it's like our government is is telling us that we need to censor true things. It's like, this is a disaster. And it's, you know, it's not just the US. Right? I think, you know, a lot of people in the US focus on this as an American phenomenon.

[00:17:38]
But I kind of think that the reaction to COVID probably caused a breakdown in trust in a lot of, governments around the world. Because, I mean, you know, 2024 was a big election year around the world. And, you know, there are all these countries, India, actually, you know, just like a a ton of countries that had that had elections. And the incumbents basically lost every single 1. So there is some sort of a global phenomenon where the the, whether it was because of inflation, because of the the economic policies to deal with, with COVID, or or just how how the governments dealt with COVID, seems to have had this effect that's global.

[00:18:23]
Not just the US, but, like, a very broad decrease in trust, at least in in that set of incumbents and maybe in in sort of these democratic institutions overall. So I I think that what you're saying of, yeah, how do people get their information now? It's by sharing it online on social media. I think that that's just increasingly true. And my view at this point is, like, alright.

[00:18:44]
Like, we start off focused on free expression. We kind of had this pressure tested over the last period. I I feel like I just have a much greater command now of what I think the policy should be, and, like, this is how it's gonna be going forward. And, and so, I'm I mean, at this point, I think, yeah, I think a lot of people look at this as, like, a purely political thing. You know, it's because they they kinda look at the timing, and they're like, hey.

[00:19:07]
Well, you're you're doing this right after the election. It's like, okay. I try not to, like, change our content rules, like, right in the middle of an election either. Right? It's like there's not, like, a great time to do this.

[00:19:15]
It's Right.

[00:19:16]
You know? And you wanna do it a year later.

[00:19:18]
Yeah. It's like there's no good time to do it. There's you know? And and whatever time is is going on, there's gonna be you know? So, the good thing about doing it after the election is you get to take this kind of cultural pulse as like, okay.

[00:19:29]
Where are people right now, and and how are people thinking about it? We try to have policies that reflect, you know, mainstream discourse. But yeah. I mean, I I don't know. This is something I've been thinking about for a while.

[00:19:41]
I think that this is gonna be pretty durable because at this point, we've just been pressure tested on this stuff for, like, the last 8 to 10 years with, like, these huge institutions just pressuring us. And, and I I I feel like this is kind of the right place to be going forward.

[00:19:58]
What was it like when they were attacking you? Like, what first of all, what was the premise? Like, what what would they what they're saying was your offense? Was it that you were allowing information that was not true, that was getting out there? I know there was also they're saying that you guys were allowing hate groups to speak.

[00:20:16]
There's a lot of this.

[00:20:17]
Yeah. I mean, the the the tough thing with politics is that there's, like well, when you say who who someone's coming after you. Are you referring to kind of the government and investigations and all that? I mean, so the the issue is that there's the there's what specific thing an agency might be looking into you for. And then there's, like, the underlying political motivation, which is, like, why do the people who are running this thing hate you?

[00:20:44]
And I know those can often be 2 very different things. So and we had organizations that were looking into us that were, like, not really involved with social media. Like, I think, like, the CFPB, like, this financial I don't even know what it stands for. It's the it's the financial organization, that Elizabeth Warren had set up.

[00:21:05]
Oh, great.

[00:21:06]
And and it's basically it's like, we're not a bank. The deep banking section. Yeah. No. So so, like, we're we're not a bank.

[00:21:13]
Right? It's like like, what what does Meta have to do with this? But they kind of found some theory that they wanted to investigate, and it's like, okay. Clearly, they were trying really hard, right, to to, like, find find some theory, but it, like I don't know. It just it kind of like, throughout the the the the the party and the government, there's just sort of I don't know if it's I don't know how this stuff works.

[00:21:34]
I mean, I've never been in government. I don't know if it's, like, a directive or it's just, like, a quiet consensus that, like, we don't like these guys. They're not doing what we want. We're gonna punish them. But, but it's, it's, it's tough to be at the other end of that.

[00:21:48]
What was it like? Well, it's not good. I think well, the the the thing that I think is actually the the toughest, though, is, it's it's global. Right? So and and, really, when you think about it, the US government should be defending its companies.

[00:22:04]
Right, not be the tip of the spear attacking its companies. So when we so we we talk about a lot, okay, what is the experience of, okay, if the US government comes after you. I I think the real issue is that when the US government does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world. Right? I mean, the the EU I I pulled these numbers.

[00:22:25]
The EU has fined the tech companies more than $30,000,000,000 over the last, I think it was, like, 10 or 20 years. Holy shoot. So when you when you think about it, like, okay, there's it's, like, you know, $100,000,000 here, a couple $1,000,000,000 there. But what what it, I think, really adds up to is this is sort of like a kind of EU wide policy for how they wanna deal with American tech. It's almost like a tariff.

[00:22:51]
And I think the US government basically gets to decide how are they gonna deal with that. Right? Because if the if the US government if if, if some other, you know, country was screwing with another industry that we cared about, the US government would probably find some way to put pressure on them. But I think what happened here is actually the complete opposite. The US government led the the kind of attack against the companies, which then just made it so, like, the EU is basically and all these other places are just free to just go to town on all the American companies and do whatever you want.

[00:23:20]
But, I mean, look, obviously, like, I don't wanna come across as if, like, we don't have things that we need to do better. Obviously, we we do. And when we mess something up, we deserve to be held accountable for that and and and just like everyone else. I do think that the American technology industry is a bright spot in the American economy. I think it's a strategic advantage for the United States that we have a lot of the strongest, companies in the world.

[00:23:45]
And I I think it should be part of the US' strategy going forward to defend that. And, and it's 1 of the things that I'm optimistic about with president Trump is I think he just wants America to win. And, and I think some of the stuff, like, the the other the other governments who are kinda pushing on on this stuff, it's, you know, it's like, at least the US has the rule of law. Right? So the government can come after you for something, but you still get your day in court, and the courts are pretty fair.

[00:24:12]
And, you know, so we've basically done a pretty good job of defending ourselves. And when we've when we've chosen to do that, basically, we we have a pretty good rate of winning. It's just not like that in every other country around the world. Like, if other governments decide that they're gonna go after you, you don't always get kind of a a clear shake at at kind of defending yourself on on on the rules. So I think to some degree, if the US tech industry is going to continue being really strong, I I do think that the US government has a role in, in basically defending it abroad.

[00:24:51]
And that's 1 of the things that I'm optimistic about will will happen in this administration.

[00:24:55]
Well, I think this is administration uniquely has felt the impact of not being able to have free speech. Because this was the this is the administration where Trump was famously kicked off of Twitter. That was a huge issue, like, after January 6th. Like, they removed

[00:25:14]
Mhmm.

[00:25:14]
The at the time, the sitting president. It was kind of crazy to remove that person from social media because you've decided that he incited a riot. So for him, without free speech, without people without podcasts, without social media, they probably wouldn't have had a chance because the mainstream narrative other than Fox News was so clearly against him. The majority of the television entities and print entities were against him, the majority of them. So if without social media, without podcast, the they don't stand a chance.

[00:25:51]
So they're uniquely aware of the importance of giving people their voice, free speech. But you do have to be careful about misinformation, and you do have to be careful about just outright lies and propaganda complaints or propaganda campaigns rather. And how do you differentiate?

[00:26:10]
Well, I I think that there are a couple of different things here. 1 is this is something where I think X and Twitter just did it better than us on on fact checking. We took the critique around fact checking. Sorry, around misinformation. We put in place this fact checking program, which basically empowered these third party fact checkers.

[00:26:25]
They can mark stuff false, and then we would downright it in the algorithm. I think what what Twitter and X have done with community notes, I think it's just a better program. Rather than having a small number of fact checkers, you get the whole community to weigh in. When people usually disagree on something, tend to agree on how they're voting on on a on a note, that's a good sign to the community that this is there's actually, like, a broad consensus on this, and then you show it. And you're showing more information, not less.

[00:26:52]
Right? So you're not using the fact check as a signal to show less. You're using the community note to provide real context, and and show additional information. So I think that that's better. For when you're talking about, like, nation states, or people interfering, a lot of that stuff is best rooted out at the level of kind of accounts doing phony things.

[00:27:19]
So you get, like you know, whether it's, like, China or Russia or Iran or, like, 1 of these countries, they'll set up these networks of of fake accounts and bots. And they coordinate, and they post on each other's stuff to make it seem like it's authentic and kinda convince people. It's like, wow. A bunch of people must think this or something. And the way that you identify that is you build AI systems that can basically detect that those accounts are not behaving the way that a human would.

[00:27:46]
And when we find that that there's, like, some bot that's operating, an account How

[00:27:52]
how do you differentiate? How do you figure that out?

[00:27:54]
It just I mean, there are some things that a person just would never do. Right? So, Have you met Lex Fridman?

[00:28:01]
Yes. No. Right?

[00:28:02]
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:28:03]
He might not be.

[00:28:04]
Well, but is he gonna take pbutt your turn or test? Yeah. No. He's gonna take a is he gonna make a million actions in a minute? It's like, no.

[00:28:10]
Yeah. Probably not. Okay. So it's that.

[00:28:11]
Well, I mean, it's things that aren't possible. Than that. I think, like Okay. These guys are pretty sophisticated, and it's an adversarial space. So, so we find some technique, and then they they basically kind of update their their techniques.

[00:28:25]
But but we have a team of there it's effectively, like, intelligence, counterintelligence folks, counterterrorism folks, AI folks who are building systems to identify, what are these accounts, that are just not behaving the way that people would, and how are they interacting. And and then sometimes you you you trace it down, and, and sometimes you get some tips from different intelligence, agencies. And then you can kind of piece together over time. It's like, oh, this network of people is actually some kind of fake cluster of accounts. And that's against our policies, then we just take them all off.

[00:29:01]
But But how do

[00:29:03]
you how are you sure? Like, is there a 100% certainty that there were that you are definitely getting a group of people that are bad actors? Or is it just people that have unpopular opinions?

[00:29:15]
No. I don't think it's that for this. I think,

[00:29:19]
But what I'm saying is how do you determine? Yeah. Like, how do you at what percentage of accuracy are you determining it? Do you ever accidentally think that people are gonna get moderated are actually just real people?

[00:29:34]
Yes. I think that's I think for the specific problem around these, like, large coordinated groups doing kind of, like, election interference or something. It's a large enough group. We have, like, a bunch of people analyzing it. It's like they study it for a while.

[00:29:47]
I think we're probably pretty accurate on that. But I actually think 1 of the bigger issues that we have in our moderation system is this precision issue that you're talking about. And that is actually, of all the things that we announced this week in terms of how we're gonna update the content policies, changing the content filters to have to require higher confidence and precision is actually going to be the thing that reduces the vast majority of the censorship mistakes that we make. Right? The, you know, the the removing the fact checkers and replacing them with community notes, I think it's a good step forward.

[00:30:22]
Like, a very small percent of content is fact checked in in the first place. So it's is that gonna make the hugest difference? I'm not sure. I think it'll be a positive step, though. And we we, like, opened up some content policies.

[00:30:35]
So some stuff that was restricted before we opened up. Okay. That's good. It'll mean that some set of things that might have been censored before or not. But by far, the biggest set of issues we have and and you and I have talked about a bunch of issues like this over the years is, like, it's just okay.

[00:30:51]
You have some clbuttifier that's it's trying to find, say, like, drug content. Right? People decide, okay. It's like the opioid epidemic is a big deal. We need to do a better job of cracking down on drugs and drug sales.

[00:31:01]
Right? I don't I don't want people dealing drugs on our networks. So we build a bunch of systems that basically go out and try to automate finding people who are who are dealing with who are dealing drugs. And then you basically have this question, which is how precise do you wanna set the clbuttifier? So do you wanna make it so that the system needs to be 99% sure that someone is is dealing drugs before taking them down?

[00:31:27]
Do you want it to be 90% confident, 80% confident? And then those correspond to amounts of, you know, I guess, the the statistics term would be recall. What percent of the bad stuff are you finding? So if you require 99% confidence, then maybe you only actually end up taking down 20% of the bad content. Whereas if you reduce it and you say, okay.

[00:31:51]
We're only gonna require 90% confidence. Now maybe you can take down 60% of the bad content. But let's say you say, no. We really need to find everyone who is doing this bad thing. And over it doesn't need to be as as severe as as dealing drugs.

[00:32:04]
It could just be, I mean, it could be any any kind of content of, any kind of category of harmful content. You you start getting to some of these clbuttifiers might have, you know, 80, 85 percent precision in order to get 90% of the bad stuff down. But the problem is if you're at, you know, 90% precision, that means 1 out of 10 things that the clbuttifier takes down is not actually problematic. And if you filter if you if you kinda multiply that across the billions of people who use our services every day, that is millions and millions of posts that are basically being taken down that are innocent. And and upon review, we're gonna look at and be like, this is ridiculous that this thing got taken down, which, I mean, I think you've had that experience, and we've talked about this for for a bunch of stuff over time.

[00:32:53]
And, but it really just comes down to this question of where do you wanna set the clbuttifiers. So 1 of the things that we're gonna do is basically set them to be, to be require more confidence, which is this trade off. It's going to mean that we will maybe take down a smaller amount of the harmful content, but it will also mean that we'll dramatically reduce the amount of people who whose accounts were taken off, for a mistake, which is just a terrible experience. Right? It's like, okay.

[00:33:20]
You're you're going about your day. And then 1 day, you wake up, and you're like, oh, my WhatsApp account just got, like, deactivated because it's connected to a Facebook account. And the Facebook account, is, is is is or, like, I'm I'm using on the same phone as a Facebook account where, like, we made some enforcement mistake and thought you were doing something bad that you weren't because our clbuttifiers were set to too low of precision.

[00:33:44]
Has that happened before? Oh, yeah. Where their WhatsApp app got canceled as well? Yeah.

[00:33:48]
Because, I mean, there is there a bunch

[00:33:50]
of Facebook app gets taken out. Like I say, if you have Facebook and you have, like, a sock puppet account, and the sock puppet account, you post offensive memes and you're generally gross. Yeah. If that if you get caught for that, does your WhatsApp get killed?

[00:34:04]
Not for memes, but but go back to, like, a very severe thing. Like, let's say someone is Terrorists.

[00:34:11]
Let's say the most severe. Sure.

[00:34:12]
Yeah. Let's say someone is is, like, terrorist content. They're planning some attack.

[00:34:15]
Right.

[00:34:16]
So we take down their account. Right? But then let's say that person can just go then sign up with another account. But I think, like, you know, right now

[00:34:24]
does WhatsApp get connected to that, though?

[00:34:26]
Oh, well, if it's I mean, we run these different services. And if they're on the same phone, it's basically you know, it's 1 thing that you know, it's basically regulators or governments will come to us and say, okay. It's you're you're clearly not doing enough if you kick someone off for terrorism, and then they can just, like, sign up for another account on the phone. Right. Okay.

[00:34:44]
You're also they also think, okay. Well, we're not doing enough if we deactivate their Facebook account because they're, like, planning a terrorist attack, but we let them use all our other services. Right.

[00:34:53]
Right? If you're aware. Yeah.

[00:34:54]
Yeah. So so if we if our systems think that someone is a terrorist, then you probably need to deactivate their their access to all the different accounts.

[00:35:02]
Yeah. They can't get on threads.

[00:35:04]
So it's just not threads. Instagram. Yeah. Yeah. So That makes sense.

[00:35:10]
So it's you can understand how you get there, but then you just get to this question around the precision and the confidence level. And then you're you're just making all these mistakes at scale, and it's just unacceptable. But I I think it's it's a very hard calculation of, like, where do you wanna be? Because on the 1 hand, like, I get it why people kind of come to us, and they're like, no. You need to do a better job finding more of the terrorism or the drugs and and all the stuff.

[00:35:37]
But, you know, over time, the technology will get better, and it'll get more precise. But at any given point in time, that's the choice that we have to make is do we wanna make more mistakes erring on the side of of just, like, blowing away innocent people's accounts

[00:35:51]
Right.

[00:35:51]
Or do we wanna, get a higher a somewhat higher percent of of the bad stuff off. And I think that there's some just some balance that you need to strike on this.

[00:35:58]
We were having a conversation yesterday, Mel Gibson and I, about how that can get weird. Was it Theo? Might have been Theo. I think it was Theo. Where that can get weird because I think, like, if you're a person and you work at some accounting firm, but you like posting about stuff, but you don't want it to come back and reflect on your life.

[00:36:17]
You wanna shoot post. You wanna post jokes. You wanna be silly. You should be able to be anonymous. I I think there's nothing wrong with that.

[00:36:25]
I don't think just because you state your opinion, people should be able to search where you sleep. That that doesn't make any sense to me. But if you're gonna allow anonymous accounts, you're definitely gonna open up the door to bad actors having enormous blocks of accounts where they can use either AI or just programs where they have, like, specific answers. I'm sure you've seen that before. It's it's come up on Twitter multiple times where they found hundreds of sock puppet accounts tweeting the exact same thing.

[00:36:56]
So you you've literally word for word even certain words in caps, like, either keep people are copying or pasting it or there's an email campaign that's getting legitimate people to do it or these are fake people. You're going to have if you're gonna have anonymous accounts, which I think you should, because I think whistleblower's I think the the benefits of anonymous reporting on important things that the general public needs to know about, especially whistleblower type stuff, you have to have some ability to be anonymous. But you are all if you're gonna do that, you're also gonna have the possibility that these aren't real people, that these are paid actors, these are paid people or not people at all or they're running programs and they're doing this to try to sway public opinion about very important issues. Yeah.

[00:37:43]
A lot of what we've seen too I mean, there's the anonymous accounts. Also, just over time, I think a lot of the kinda more interesting conversations have shifted from the public sphere to more private ones. So WhatsApp groups.

[00:37:56]
Mhmm.

[00:37:56]
Private groups on on Facebook. I'm sure you have this experience where, like, maybe 10 years ago, you would have posted your kind of quick takes on on whatever social media you're using. Now, you know, the stuff that I post on on Facebook and Instagram, it's like I put time into into making sure that that's kind of good content that that I wanna be seen broadly. Yeah. And then, like, most of the jokes that I make are, like, with my friends in WhatsApp.

[00:38:19]
Exactly. Yeah. So, yeah, I I think that that's sort of that's kind of where the world is more broadly now.

[00:38:25]
Yeah. Yeah. No. I think so for jokes, for that kind of stuff, with for comedians, for sure. Because also, we'll say things that we don't really mean.

[00:38:34]
We just say it because it's a funny thing to say.

[00:38:36]
I think everyone does. For sure.

[00:38:38]
Yeah. Which is just a weird thing about taking things out of context, particularly on social media where people love to do that. But there is this problem of, like, let's just say that you're a country that's involved in some sort of an international conflict and you have this ability to get out this fake narrative and just spread it widely about all sorts of things you're accusing this other government of, all sorts of things that aren't true.

[00:39:07]
Yeah.

[00:39:07]
And it just muddies the water of reality for a lot of people.

[00:39:11]
Yeah. And that's why that side of things, the kind of governments running these broad manipulation campaigns, I mean, we're not letting off the gas on that at all. I think ever like, most most categories of bad stuff that we're policing, everyone agrees are is bad. Right? No one's sitting there defending that terrorism is good, right, or child exploitation or drugs or IP violations or people inciting violence or it's like most of the stuff is bad.

[00:39:38]
People clearly believe that, that, you know, election interference and foreign government manipulation of content is bad. So we we have this is the type of stuff that the vast majority of our energy goes towards that, and we're not changing our approach on any of that. The 2 categories that I think have been very politicized are misinformation, because who gets to judge or what's false and what's true. You may just not like my opinion on something, and then, you know, people think it's false. But it but it's, but I think that that one's really tricky.

[00:40:10]
And the other 1 is, is basically what, you know, what people refer to as hate speech, which is, I think, also comes from a good place of, you know, wanting to crack down on that of, of wanting to promote more inclusion and and and belonging and people feeling, feeling good and, like, having a a pluralistic society that can, that can basically have all these different communities coexist. Except everyone. Yeah. But I think the problem is is that, you know, you just all these things are on a spectrum, and when you go too far on them, you know, I think on on that side, we just basically got to this point where there were these things that you just, like, couldn't say which were mainstream discourse. Right?

[00:40:53]
So, you know, it's like Pete Hegseth is going to, you know, probably be defending his nomination for secretary of defense on on the, senate floor. And I think 1 of the points that he's made is that he thinks that women shouldn't be able to be in certain combat roles. And until we updated our policies, that wouldn't have been a thing that you could have said on our platforms because it would call for the exclusion of a protected category of people. And so and it's like, okay. Like, on its on its face, yeah, calling for the exclusion of a protected category, that seems that, like, that's okay.

[00:41:25]
There's, like, legal protections. There's all the stuff. But, okay, if it's, like, okay to say on the floor of congress, you should probably be able to debate it on social media. Yeah. So, so I think some of the stuff, I think, well intentioned, went too far, needs to just get rationalized a bit.

[00:41:42]
But but it's those 2 categories. Misinformation and hate speech, I think, are the ones that got politicized. All the other ones, which is the vast majority of of the stuff that we do, is, I think people generally agree that it's that it's good and we need to go after it. But then you just get into this problem of the mistakes like you're talking about. Okay.

[00:42:00]
Well, what confidence level do do people want us to have, in in our enforcement? And at what point would people rather us kind of say, okay. I'm not sure that that's, that that 1 is causing an issue. So do you so on balance, maybe we should just, you know, leave that person's account up because the pain of just nuking someone's account when you're not sure or you make a mistake is, like, that's pretty real too.

[00:42:22]
Right. Yeah. Very, very complicated. Yeah. It's it's all very nuanced.

[00:42:28]
And, you know, you made a point earlier about the the government supporting its companies, that it would be a good thing for the government to support its companies. It makes sense. It's an American company. I think the issue that we're dealing with is companies, as we're describing them, have never existed before. Right?

[00:42:48]
There's never been a thing like Facebook before. There's never been a thing like Twitter before or x. It's never been a thing like Instagram. These are new things in terms of the impact that it has on society, on opinions, on conversations, on distribution of information. There's never been a thing like this that the government didn't control.

[00:43:09]
So it makes sense from their perspective continuing the patterns of behavior that they've always exhibited, which is to have control over the media. I mean, there has been CIA operatives that have been in major newspapers forever. There's always been that. There's always been this sort of input that the government had in mainstream media narratives. They are in a position now where they're losing that.

[00:43:34]
There's they've essentially lost it. And especially with this last, the push during COVID deteriorated as you were saying before the opinion and the respect that people have for the facts that are coming from mainstream journalism in a way that I've never seen before in my life, where an an enormous percentage of the population does not trust mainstream media anymore. So, well, what do they trust? They trust social media. Well, who's running that?

[00:43:58]
Well, there are a bunch of people who figured it out and invented it. Well, then freak that. Like, we gotta crack down on that. Like, we've gotta get our hands on this, which is what we saw during COVID, which is we saw during the Biden administration's attempt to remove the Hunter Biden laptop story from Twitter and from all these different things that we saw happen, the way they contacted you guys, what they're trying to do with getting you to remove real information about vaccine side effects like that. This is, like, this new attempt to crack down on this new thing, which is a distribution outlet that's far more successful than anything they've ever controlled before, and they have no control of it.

[00:44:38]
Right? They they had CBS. They had NBC. They had when they had the New York Times and all these Washington Post, when they were in control of narratives in that way, it was so much easier. There there wasn't some sort of pirate radio voice that came on and said, hey, guys.

[00:44:54]
Look, here's the the latest studies that shows this is not true. Here's why they're lying about that. Here's why they're lying about this. And now that's what you get all day long on x. It's all day long.

[00:45:05]
It's like dissolving illusions. Mhmm. And that's a completely new thing that probably led to Trump getting elected.

[00:45:15]
Yeah. I mean, the causality there is tricky. But, because there's a lot of things. I mean, there's a lot of things. But without

[00:45:21]
it, he probably doesn't get elected.

[00:45:25]
It's yeah. It's tough to know. I mean, I I do come back to this point that there were every major incumbent lost their elections around the world.

[00:45:33]
But I think that's also But

[00:45:34]
it might it might it might it might be it might be because of that revealing how how kind of incorrect and and dishonest I think some of these governments were. Yes. Yeah. So I know that's that's quite possible. And, I mean, I I do think that there is this cycle that goes on where, you know, within a society, it's not just the government that has power.

[00:45:55]
There's, like, certain people who are in these, like, culturally elite positions. And, you know, journalists, TV news anchors, like, who are the people who people broadly trust. Right? They're they're not all in government. They're, like, a lot a lot of people, in other positions.

[00:46:10]
It's like, who are the people that that, basically people look to? And, I think that's basically it needs to shift for the Internet age. And I think a lot of the people who, you know, people look to before, they're kinda realizing, hey. They weren't super honest about a lot of these issues that we that we face. And I know that's partially why, you know, social media isn't a monolithic thing.

[00:46:35]
It's not that people trust Facebook or x. They trust the creators and the voices that that they feel like are being authentic and giving them valuable information on there. So there's, I think, gonna be just this whole new clbutt of creators who basically become the new kind of cultural elites that people look at and are, like, okay. These are the people who give it to me straight. And I think that that's that's a thing that is maybe it's it's possible because of social media.

[00:47:05]
I I think it's also just the Internet more broadly. I mean, I think podcasting is obviously a huge and important part of that too. I mean, I don't I don't know to what extent you feel like you kind of got to be large, like, because of social media or just it's or just the podcasting platforms that you used. But, but I know that this is, like, a very big sea change in terms of, like, who are the voices that matter. And, you know, what we do is we we try to build a platform that gives people a voice.

[00:47:31]
But I know there's this wholesale generational shift in who are the people who are being listened to. And I think that that's, like, a very fascinating thing that is going on, because I I I think that that's, like, what is what's going on here. It's not it's it's not just the government, and people saying, hey. We we want, like, a very big change here. I think it's just like a wholesale shift in saying, we just want different people who we actually trust

[00:47:57]
Right.

[00:47:57]
Who who are actually gonna, like, tell us the truth and, like, and not give us, like, the bullshoot opinions that you're supposed to say, but, like, the type of stuff that I would actually, like, when I'm sitting with my in my living room with my friends, like, the stuff that we know is true. Like, who are the people who kind of have the courage to actually just say that stuff? I don't know. I I think that whole, like, cultural elite clbutt needs to get repopulated with people who people actually trust.

[00:48:21]
Yeah. The problem is these people that are starting these jobs, they're coming out of universities. And and the universities are indoctrinated into these ideas as well. It's it's very difficult to be a person who stands outside of that and takes unpopular positions. You get socially ostracized and people are very they're very hesitant to do that, and they would rather just keep their mouth shut and talk about it in quiet conversation.

[00:48:47]
And that's what we experience, which is another another argument for anonymous accounts. I think you should have anonymous accounts with I think you should be able like, if there's something like COVID mandates or some things that you're dealing with and you don't wanna get fired because of it, you should be able to talk about it.

[00:49:03]
Mhmm. And you

[00:49:03]
should be able to post facts and information and what you've learned. And, you know, anecdotal experiences of people in your family that had vaccine side effects and not worry about losing your job, which people were worried about, which is so crazy. And, you know, and you're seeing a lot of the people that used to be in mainstream media got fired, and now they're trying to do the sort of podcast thing. But they're trying to do it like a mainstream media person. So they're like gaslighting during podcasts, and people are like, hey, freakface.

[00:49:35]
Like, this you you can't do that here. It doesn't work.

[00:49:39]
Yeah. It's a well, it's a new medium. I mean, I I know I'm sure you know the history on this. It's like when when people transition from radio to TV, the initial TV anchors were the same radio people, but just, like, being filmed while speaking on the radio. But it turned out it actually was a completely different type of person that you need, because on your radio, it's just, like, your voice and your cadence and all that.

[00:49:59]
It's like, you know, the the whole phrase. It's like you've got a good radio voice. Right? It's like Yeah. Okay.

[00:50:04]
On TV, you need to be telegenic. Right? You need to kind of has have charisma in that medium. It's, like, a completely different thing. And, I think that that's gonna be true for the Internet too.

[00:50:15]
It's, you know, it's not as cut. Or I think part of it is the format. Right? The fact that you do these, like, 2, 3 hour episodes I mean, I hated doing TV because, you know, I basically got started I started Facebook when I was 19, and I was good at some things, very bad at others. I was good at coding and, like, real bad at at kind of, like, talking to people and explaining what I was doing.

[00:50:40]
And I just, like, had these experiences early on where I'd go on TV, and, like, it wouldn't go well. And they'd, like, cut to they'd cut it to some down to some random sound bite, and I'd, like, look stupid. And then, like, and then, basically, like, I'd get super nervous about about, like, going on TV because I knew that they were just gonna cut it in some way that I was gonna look like a freaking idiot. And, like and so I'm just like, this sucks. Right?

[00:51:06]
So so I just like it's it's kind of a funny thing about, like it was, like, in some ways, it's like, okay. At the same time, I was, you know, gaining confidence, being able to, like, build more and more complicated products. And it's even as an early twenties person, I was like, I could do this. And then on the kind of TV and comms public side, I was like, this is a disaster. Every time I go out, it's worse and worse and worse, and it just gets so but but, I mean, it's it's 1 of the reasons why I think on the Internet, like, there's no reason to cut it to a 4 minute sound bite conversation.

[00:51:38]
It's like I think part of what what makes it authentic is, like, we can just I mean, these are complex issues. We can unpack it for hours and and probably still have hours more stuff to talk about. It just it's I I don't know. I I think it's just more real.

[00:51:51]
Yeah. It's definitely that. And the the other thing about television that's always gonna hold it back is the fact that every conversation gets interrupted every x amount of minutes because you have to cut to a commercial. So you you really can't get into depth. Even Bill Maher shows only an hour.

[00:52:08]
You know, you have all these people talking over each other, then you sit down with 1 person for a short amount of time. It's just not enough time for important subjects. It's also a lot of them, for whatever reason, wanna do in front of an audience, which is the worst way to get people to talk. Mhmm. Like, when you imagine these disasters that you had, if there was, like, 5,000 people staring at you in a TV crowd as

[00:52:28]
well. Yeah.

[00:52:29]
So there's that added element Yeah. Which is so not normal and not conducive to having a conversation where you're talking about nuanced things Yeah. Where you have to, like, think. You have to be able to pause and and not concern yourself being entertaining for these freaking people just sitting there staring at you.

[00:52:47]
Yeah. And and, also, like, when you're having a conversation, say it, like I don't know. It's like when you start talking about something, your kind of subconscious kicks in. You start thinking about the the topic. So it's like you might not actually have the thing that you wanna say until, like, 5 minutes later.

[00:53:01]
Right. And Right. I mean, it's like, when we started this conversation, I think, like, the first few minutes were just kinda slow. It's like warming up. Like, I'm like, okay.

[00:53:07]
Kinda like downloading into my memory. Like, how how am I gonna, like you know, it's like, how am I gonna, you know, just explain these different things? But it's, yeah. No. I just think that that's sort of how people work.

[00:53:19]
Well, it's also like it's conversations are like a dance. You know. 1 person can't be dancing at another speed and the other person is going slow. Like, you kinda have to find the rhythm that you're gonna talk with and then you have to actually be interested in what you're talking about. That's another thing that they are at a huge disadvantage of in mainstream media.

[00:53:38]
It's like, they're just doing that because that's their job. You know, they probably don't even know a lot about climate change. They probably don't really understand too much about what space SpaceX is trying to accomplish, but they're just reporting on

[00:53:50]
it. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure there's the and a lot of the people I've met there, I think, are good people.

[00:53:54]
I'm sure.

[00:53:55]
It's just a tough format.

[00:53:56]
Right? It's a tough format. Yeah. And the problem is they get locked into that format, and no 1 trusts them. And then they leave, and they go, yeah.

[00:54:02]
But you were just lying to us about this, that, and the other thing. And now I'm supposed to believe you're 1 of the good guys. You're 1 of the straight shooters now. Yeah. Well, getting back to the original point, this is why I think, you know, it makes sense to me that the government didn't want you to succeed and to have the sort of unchecked power that they perceived social media to to have.

[00:54:30]
And I think 1 of the benefits that we have now of the Trump administration is that they have clearly felt the repercussions of a limited amount of free speech, of free speech limitations, censorship, government overreach. If anybody saw it look, it there's I don't know what the actual impact of the Hunter Biden laptop story would have been. I don't know. But there's many people that think it probably amounted to millions of votes overall in the country of people that were on the fence, the people that weren't sure who they're gonna vote for. If they found out the Hunter Biden laptop was real, they're like, oh, this is freaked.

[00:55:06]
Their family's freaking crazy. And they would have voted for Trump. That's possibly real. And if that's possibly real, that could be defined as election interference. And all that stuff scares the shoot out of me.

[00:55:19]
That kind of stuff scares the shoot out of me. When the government gets involved in what could be termed election interference, but through some weird loophole, it's legal. Whereas some Well, I I don't think I

[00:55:31]
don't think that the pushing for social media companies to censor stuff was legal. I mean, it's, like, that's I mean, there's all the stuff about what the like, people talk about the first amendment and okay. These these tech platforms should should offer free speech like the First Amendment. It's that, I think, is a philosophical principle. The First Amendment doesn't apply to companies and what in our content moderation.

[00:55:53]
It's more of an American ethos about how we think that that, you know, best dialog is carried out. But the first amendment does apply to the government. That's, like, the whole point. Right? It's the government is not allowed to censor this stuff.

[00:56:06]
So at some level, I do think that, you know, having people in the administration calling up the guys on our team and yelling at them and cursing and threatening repercussions if we don't take down things that are true is, like, it's pretty bad. It sounds illegal. I would love to

[00:56:25]
hear it. I wish somebody recorded those conversations. Well, I

[00:56:28]
mean because it'd be I mean, again, it's well great to listen to.

[00:56:30]
Somebody could animate them, maybe PolyTune? The animate. A a lot

[00:56:34]
of the material is is public. I mean, it's I mean, Jim Jordan led this whole investigation in the Yeah. In Congress. I mean, it was basically I think about this as, like you know, what Elon did on the Twitter files when he took over that company, I think Jim Jordan basically did that for the rest of the industry with the the congressional investigation that he did. And we just turned over, like, all of the documents and everything that we had, to them, and they basically put together this report.

[00:57:01]
And the people that actually did call for censorship,

[00:57:04]
what was the response to all this?

[00:57:08]
To what? To the to the investigation? Yes. I don't know.

[00:57:12]
I don't know. Did was anybody held accountable? Was there any I mean any repercussions?

[00:57:19]
I mean, they lost the election.

[00:57:20]
Yes. So that's it. That's I

[00:57:22]
mean, that's it. Well, in a democracy, I mean, that's kinda right? Right.

[00:57:27]
But if the if what they did was illegal, do you not think that some steps should be put in place to make sure that people are punished for that and that that never happens again? It seems that that has an a mbuttive impact on the way our country goes. If that's election interference, and I think it is, that has a mbuttive impact on the direction of our country.

[00:57:51]
Yeah. Well, the COVID thing, I don't think, was election interference as much as it was just, like, government meddling where it shouldn't have. But yeah. No. I mean, it's No.

[00:57:59]
I'm I'm talking about the underbowed last week.

[00:58:01]
Say, you know, like, what specific retribution or justice should happen to anyone who is involved in these things. But I think your point about, let's make sure this doesn't happen again

[00:58:13]
Yeah.

[00:58:14]
Is, is the 1 that I'm more focused on. Right? Because it's the thing that I reflect on on my journey on all this, which is like, okay. Yeah. So we didn't take down the stuff that was true, but we did generally defer to the government on some of these policies that in retrospect, I probably wouldn't knowing what I know now.

[00:58:36]
And, and I I just think that that's that's sort of the journey that we've been on. It's like, k. We start the thing focused on free expression, go through some, like, pretty crazy times in the world, get it pressure tested, see where we basically ended up doing stuff that led to a slippery slope that we weren't happy with the conclusion, and, like, try to reset. And that's sort of the moment that we're at now is is trying to just rationalize, a bunch of a bunch of the policies. And and, look, I mean, obviously, crazy things can happen in the future that might unearth something that I haven't, you know, some some kind of angle on this that I haven't, thought enough about yet.

[00:59:14]
So I don't know. I'm sure I'm not done making mistakes in the world. But, but I think at this point, we have a much more thorough understanding of what the space is. And I I I think our our kind of values and principles on this are likely going to be much more durable going forward. And and I think that that's probably a good thing for the Internet.

[00:59:35]
I think it's a great thing for the Internet. I was very happy with your announcement. I'm very happy that you took those steps. I'm very happy you brought Dana White aboard.

[00:59:42]
Oh, he's awesome. Been talking to him for a while. About that. I mean, he's like talk about, like, an amazing entrepreneur. Right?

[00:59:47]
It's like, I just want like, because I control our company, I have the benefit of not having to convince the board not to fire me. Right? It's like a normal corporate environment. It's like, basically, the CEO just tries to, like you know, they're just trying to convince the board to, like, let them have their job and pay them more. It's like, alright.

[01:00:04]
The board doesn't pay me except for security, and, and I'm not worried about losing my job, because I control the majority of the voting in in the company. So I actually get to use our board to, like, have the smartest people who I can get to have around me help work on these problems. So it's like, alright. Who are the people I want? Like, I I just want, like, the best entrepreneurs and people who've created different things.

[01:00:26]
And, like, I mean, Dana is, like, this guy who I mean, he basically took the sport from being this, like I think it was viewed as, like, this pretty marginal thing when he got started. Right? I mean, John McCain was trying to outlaw it and Yeah. And, you know, now it's like and I think it and f 1 are the 2 fastest growing sports in the world. It's got 100 of millions of people viewing it.

[01:00:46]
It's like I mean, what Dana's done with the UFC is, like, 1 of the most legendary business stories, and, and the brand is beloved. And and I think he's just, so he's, like, a world clbutt entrepreneur, and he's just like a he's got a strong backbone. And I think part of what the conversation that I had with him around joining our board was, okay. Like, we have a lot of governments and folks around the world putting a lot of pressure on our company, and, like, we need some, like, strong people who are gonna basically, you know, help help advise us on how to handle some of these situations. And, and so yeah.

[01:01:26]
That's but but, yeah, I mean, this is running this company is not for the faint of heart. I mean, you definitely there's definitely a lot of pressure from from, like, all these different governments. And and then then it's like, okay. I could spend all my time doing that, but I'm not even a politician. Like, I wanna I just wanna spend my time building things.

[01:01:40]
Right? So so it's, so, yeah, I I think Dana's gonna be great.

[01:01:44]
He's the best. Great entrepreneur. I agree with everything you said about him. Without him, none of the UFC would have ever taken place the way it did. I mean, you needed the Fertitta brothers.

[01:01:51]
They had to come in with all the money and the vision. And it's really funny because Eddie Bravo and I you know, we've been fans for so long. Eddie Bravo and I went to a live event in the nineties. I was working for the UFC as a backstage interviewer, and he went there with Ricky Rocket. You know Ricky Rocket from Poison?

[01:02:08]
No. He's a freaking black belt under the Machados. He's legit. Super legit. Really nice guy too.

[01:02:15]
Anyway, so Ricky Rocket and him were at the, UFC, and we were talking about it in the nineties. So, like, you know what the sport needs? Because we were in love with it. We're like this but we were martial artists. We're like, the sport needs some billionaires who just throw a ton of money at it and just get it huge.

[01:02:32]
And then the Ferdida brothers come along. Mhmm. Billionaires with a ton of money who are huge fans of the sport. Mhmm. Just love the sport.

[01:02:41]
You know, we're hiring people like Frank Shamrock to come in and train them and work out and we're taking jiu jitsu with John Lewis and they were really getting into it. And so then they buy the UFC for, like, $2,000,000 which is probably the greatest purchase ever, except they were 40 plus $1,000,000 in the hole Mhmm. When they financed the ultimate fighter. And then that was 2,005, and then this 1 fight takes place with Stefan Bader and Forrest Griffin on television. It's so wild and so crazy that millions of people start tuning in.

[01:03:12]
The sport's born. Then you have Chuck Liddell who was the champion at the time, who was the most fan friendly champion you could ever have, just a freaking Berserker with just psychopath with a freaking head tattoo and a mohawk crushing people. In his prime. He was the perfect poster guy for the UFC because he was just smashing people and then throwing his arms back like in a cage. It was nuts.

[01:03:36]
I'm sure you've seen a lot of Chuck Waddell fights. Right? Yeah. It is it was just the the whole thing took off. But without Dana, it would have never taken place.

[01:03:44]
The guy's tireless. That man, I could call him up. I'll call him up at, like, 2 o'clock in the morning sometime. Like, there's some fight going on. And I'll say, hey, This is going on next weekend.

[01:03:53]
I'm so freaking pumped and hit we'll we'll talk for hours for hours. He just wants to talk about fights. He's, like, so locked in, like, all the time, you know? And he's he's just, like, so driven. He was and now that he's healthy, like, oh my god.

[01:04:08]
He's got what Gary Breck has done for him is incredible. He lost all his weight, got super thin, real fit, super healthy. He doesn't freak around with alcohol anymore. He just eats healthy food. He looks great.

[01:04:20]
Now he's getting even more energy. Yeah. It's incredible.

[01:04:23]
Well, we're lucky to have some of it.

[01:04:25]
Yeah. We are. And you know what? We're also lucky that you got into jujitsu because I think I think that had an effect on you. You look different.

[01:04:34]
When you walked in here today, you look thicker. You look like a different guy. You do. You look like a jujitsu guy now. It's funny.

[01:04:40]
I saw your neck. I'm like, his neck's bigger. Your neck is bigger. Good. Are you using iron neck, or is it just

[01:04:46]
I do like I do like iron neck. But but it's but when I started training not just jujitsu, but striking, I was like, alright. I wanna find a way to do this where I don't, like, like, hurt my brain. Right? It's like, alright.

[01:05:00]
Like, I need to I'm gonna be running this company for a while. I would like to

[01:05:03]
Yeah.

[01:05:03]
You know, like, stay stay healthy and not take too much damage. And so I think the number 1 thing you need to do is well, in addition to having good partners is, have a strong neck. Yes. So yeah. So yeah.

[01:05:16]
No. I I take that I take that pretty seriously.

[01:05:18]
It's very important. A strong neck is great for jiu jitsu as well because it's a weapon, like, in certain positions, like, head and arm chokes. Yeah. You need a neck.

[01:05:26]
Yeah.

[01:05:27]
Yeah. It's a weapon. Yeah. And, you know, and also for defending things and just for overall stability. But for striking, it's very like Mike Tyson in his prime.

[01:05:36]
He had

[01:05:36]
a freaking 20 inches neck. Yeah. No. It's crazy. His neck is, like, bigger than his his face.

[01:05:41]
A photo of him in a suit. It's the craziest photo. It's like his neck starts at the top of his ears and it just goes straight down

[01:05:47]
Yeah.

[01:05:48]
When he was a champ, when

[01:05:49]
he was a tank. Amazing.

[01:05:50]
Yeah. The neck's very important. But it's also, like, you know, you're doing it very smart. You're you're bringing in Dave Camarillo.

[01:05:58]
He's awesome. Amazing. He's awesome.

[01:06:00]
You're bringing in all these, like, super talented people to train with you too, which is really important and just learn systematically, probably the way you've learned all these other things, which is really so fascinating to me about MMA and and jiu jitsu in particular, is the general public has this knuckle dragging meathead sort of perspective. And then I'm like, let me introduce you to Mikey Musumeci. Yeah.

[01:06:25]
Well, there's there's a range.

[01:06:26]
There's a

[01:06:27]
range for Mikey to Right.

[01:06:28]
But Mikey is 1 of the elite of the elite, and he's about as far from that.

[01:06:32]
I love Mikey. He's he's a very good guy. He's super good guy.

[01:06:35]
He's super kind and and unbelievably brilliant and eccentric

[01:06:40]
Mhmm.

[01:06:40]
And just and just so dedicated jiu jitsu.

[01:06:42]
Right? Yeah. I'm I'm glad I'm glad that he's over at the UFC now.

[01:06:45]
Yes. I am too. Yeah. Well, I'm glad a guy like that exists. I I like because I like I'm like, okay.

[01:06:50]
I know you think that. Let me show you this guy. And then, like, let me show you what it really is. Let me introduce you to these people because they're the nicest people. I know.

[01:06:58]
There's no better stress reliever in the world than jujitsu or martial arts. There's no better. You you leave there. You're the kindest person in the world. You just, like, heal all of your aggressions out of your system.

[01:07:08]
Yeah. And it's a phenomenal stress reliever because regardless of what you're going through day to day with Facebook and Meta and all the different projects you have going on, it's not as hard as someone trying to just choke you unconscious.

[01:07:20]
It's it's not as acute. I think it's like, sometimes you have someone trying to choke you unconscious slowly over a multi month multiyear period, and that's that's business. But Right. But no. I think that sometimes in business, the cycle time is so long that it is very refreshing to just have a feedback loop that's like, oh, I, like, had my hand down, so I got punched in the face.

[01:07:42]
It's like that's like Yeah. That's, but yeah. I know. I it's it's really important to me for balance. I mean, I I basically try to train every morning.

[01:07:52]
I'm I'm either doing general fitness or or kind of MMA. I'm do sometimes grappling, sometimes striking, or sometimes both. But, it got to the point where I'm not I I tore my ACL training. I was probably, at that point, I didn't have I wasn't integrated between my weight training and my fighting training, so I think I was probably overdoing it. So now Mhmm.

[01:08:14]
Now we basically I'm I'm just trying to do this in a cohesive way, which I I think will be more sustainable. But when I when I tore my ACL, first of all, everyone at the company was like, ah, freak. We're gonna get so many more emails now. It's like that that he can't that he can't do this. And then and I sat down with Priscilla, and I expected her to be like, you're an idiot.

[01:08:35]
Like, what do you expect? You're like you know, I was in my late thirties at the time, and but she was like, no. She's like, when you heal your ACL, you better go back to fighting. And I'm like, what do what do you mean? She's like, you are so much better to be around now that you're doing this.

[01:08:49]
You have to fight. And so That's hilarious. Yeah. So, and, Isn't

[01:08:54]
it funny that, like, that's completely contrary to the way most people, if they're outside of it, would perceive it?

[01:09:01]
I mean, it it definitely takes the edge off things. But it's, like, after, like, a couple of hours of doing that in the morning, it's just, like yeah. It's, like, nothing else that day is gonna stress you out that much. Right? You can just

[01:09:12]
you can just deal with it. Voluntary adversity.

[01:09:16]
Yeah. Yeah. No. It's good. It's good.

[01:09:18]
It's also good, I think, to be a little bit tired. Like, it's like it just it's I love that feeling of just, like, you're not, like, exhausted. And sometimes you get a session and you just go so hard, and you I need to, like, just go to sleep or something. But Yeah.

[01:09:32]
It's also good to know that you can kill people. That's that's a good thing to know. It's a good thing to know if something goes sideways.

[01:09:40]
I guess there's a there's a certain conflict around that. Yeah.

[01:09:43]
It's an important skill. Yeah.

[01:09:44]
If you

[01:09:45]
could give it in a pill, if you could sell it in a pill, everybody would buy it. Yeah. A 100 no 1 would say I'd like to be the vulnerable guy walking around with a bunch of freaking buttbuttins.

[01:09:54]
Yeah.

[01:09:54]
No 1 would say that. They would say, how much is the pill? Oh, it's $2. Oh, give me 1 of those pills. You take the pill.

[01:10:00]
Everybody would take that pill. Well, it exists. It's just not a pill. It's a long journey of pain and discipline and and trial and error and learning and being open minded and being objective and understanding position, asking questions and asking questions, and having good training partners, and absorbing information, and really being diligent with your skill acquisition work, which is 1 of the most important and neglected parts of jujitsu because training is so fun. Everybody just wants to roll, you know.

[01:10:30]
Yeah. Where really the best way to do it is actually to drill and Mhmm. It's the most boring, but really you should drill constantly just jam those skills into your neurons where your brain knows exactly what to do in every position. And it's such an intellectual pursuit. And most people don't think of it that way because you have to manage your mind while you're moving your body.

[01:10:50]
You're managing anxieties. You're you're you're trying to figure out when to hit the gas and when to control position and recover. There's so much going on in training that applies to virtually any stressful thing that you'll ever experience in your life. And along with it, you get this skill where you can kill people. You shouldn't kill people.

[01:11:14]
Let me be clear. I'm not saying it's a good thing to kill people. I'm definitely not. But I'm saying it's a good thing to if someone's trying to kill you and they absolutely can't because you could kill them easy, that's way better. It's a way better situation to be in.

[01:11:28]
Yeah. No. It's it's great. I mean, it's it's open a lot of how I think about stuff. I mean, it's it is just interesting when your your point about, like, having a pill that allows you to just kind of know that you have this kind of physical ability.

[01:11:45]
It's,

[01:11:46]
It's a superpower.

[01:11:47]
It's it's interesting because I I do think a lot of our society has become very, like I don't know. I don't even know the right word for it, but it's like it kinda, like, neutered or, like, emasculated. And it's there's, like, a whole energy in this that I I think it's it is very healthy in the right balance. I mean, I think part of the reason I mean, every 1 of the things that I enjoy about it is that I feel like I can just, like, express myself. Right?

[01:12:16]
It's like when you're running a company, people typically don't wanna see you being, like, this ruthless person who's, like, just like, I'm just gonna, like, crush the people I'm competing with. But, like, but when you're fighting, it's like, no. No. That's like so I I think in some worded. I think in some ways, when people see me competing in the sport, they're like, oh, no.

[01:12:34]
That's the real mark. It's like because it's it goes back to the all the media training stuff we were talking about when I'm going and doing my sound bites for 2 minutes. It's like, no. It's like, freak that guy. It's like, that's the real 1.

[01:12:45]
It's but,

[01:12:47]
well, you definitely got a lot of respect in the martial arts community. People get super excited that you were so involved in it and so interested in it because anytime someone like yourself or like Tom Hardy or anyone they're like, wow, that guy's into it? Like, wow. Anytime something like that happens and there's, like, some new person who's a prominent person, a very smart person, it's really interested in it, we all get very excited because we're, like, oh, boy.

[01:13:08]
It's a very welcoming community. Super. I I think

[01:13:11]
there's a lot of

[01:13:12]
a lot of sports are, like, nah. We don't want you.

[01:13:14]
It's not a jock community. No. No. No. Super kind.

[01:13:17]
Yeah. Like, jujitsu people in in particular, they're some of the nicest pea and those are my friends forever. You know? They'll be my friends for life.

[01:13:24]
Yeah. Yeah. No. It's it's a it's a good crew. I mean, when I got hurt, I I really kinda missed the guys I trained with.

[01:13:30]
I mean, it's like Davis put together this this group. It's basically these, like all these young pro fighters who are kind of, like, up and coming, like, kind of early twenties, but they've only been doing it for a few years. So, like, I've been doing it for for a few years. That way, it's like we kind of are have a more similar level of skill, and they're all better than me. But, like, but in terms of I'm like I was in my late thirties, and they're in their early twenties.

[01:13:52]
It was sort of, like, they're kind of be coming into Becoming Men. I'm, like, sort of at the end of my fiscal peak, but it's, like, it's, it's, it's it's a really good crew. Yeah. No. It's a good crew.

[01:14:05]
And the competing thing is fun. I can't wait to get back to that too. I mean, it's, like, basically I mean, I was also doing it with so it's basically some a group of pro fighters and then a handful of meta executives would do it. And then, basically, we would just kinda, like, fight each other, and it would be fun. And and, and then 1 of them decided 1 day that they're they're like, you know, I think I'm getting pretty good at jiu jitsu.

[01:14:27]
I'm gonna go to a tournament. And I was like, alright. Good luck with that, bro. Like, I'm I'm not going to I'm not gonna go to tournament. It's like they gotta like, I don't wanna go to a tournament and get him get embarrbutted.

[01:14:37]
It's like like but then the guy goes to the tournament. He, like, does pretty well. I'm like, that guy? It's like it's like, okay. It's like, we go all the time and, like, and, if if he's doing well in the tournament, that's like, alright.

[01:14:49]
Fine. Sign me up. Right? It's like so, I mean, because it's just, like, super competitive. So this was, like, when was this?

[01:14:57]
It must have been I don't know. I guess I I rolled into this tournament, and I registered under my first and middle name. So people didn't know who who I was. And I had, like, sunglbuttes and a hat, and I wore a COVID mask. And, like, and I and, basically, it was like it wasn't until they called our names to step onto the mat that I was like, alright.

[01:15:19]
I took all this stuff off, and they go, like, what?

[01:15:22]
That's kind of a cheat code.

[01:15:24]
I mean

[01:15:25]
yeah. Kinda kinda freak out. I, yeah,

[01:15:27]
I think he was trying to figure out what was going on. Afterwards, his his, coach was like he was like, I think that was Mark Zuckerberg who who just submitted me. And the the coach is like, no. No no no way. Then he's like, no.

[01:15:39]
I think that was. He's like, what? You're you're fighting Mark Zuckerberg. He said, get back in there. It's like, get get go find him.

[01:15:44]
He's like, no. He just submitted me. It's

[01:15:51]
That's very funny. Yeah, man. Well, Tom Hardy's doing that too. Right? He's done multiple tournaments now.

[01:15:56]
Yeah. No. I think I think yeah. Yeah. I I I can't wait wait to get back to competing.

[01:16:05]
It's been it's been sort of a slow journey on the the rehab. It's sort of like learning twice. Mhmm. But but we're we're getting there.

[01:16:10]
How far out are you?

[01:16:11]
Oh, no. I'm done with the rehab now. Now I'm just ramping up.

[01:16:14]
Far out are you from surgery?

[01:16:18]
12, 12 months. 13 months.

[01:16:20]
So you did the patella tendon graft. Right?

[01:16:23]
I did. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:16:24]
That's a rough 1 to come back from. I did, the patella tendon graft on my left knee, and it took me about a year. I did the ACL from a cadaver. It's actually they use an Achilles tendon from a cadaver on my right knee, and I was back to jujitsu in 6 months. Like, full confidence in 6 months.

[01:16:41]
I was Interesting. 100% recovered, kicking the bag, everything. Yeah.

[01:16:46]
Yeah. How how, how old were you when you got those?

[01:16:50]
The first 1, I was 26. The second 1, I was 30 1, 32, somewhere around there.

[01:17:02]
Oh, so so young? Yeah. Because I mean, my my doctor is basically like, look, you're at the you're, like, at the boundary. You could go either way. But if you wanna compete again, then I'd recommend doing the patella.

[01:17:12]
Yeah. I know they say that. I don't agree with that. I mean, just from my own personal experience, my doctor told me that the ACL from a cadaver when they use the patella tendograft is a 150% stronger than your natural ACL. He said you'll be back to because I didn't have any meniscus damage on my right knee.

[01:17:29]
He's like you'll be back to a 100%. I have a lot of meniscus damage on my left knee unfortunately, which is also part of the problem with the recovery of that 1. But the, patella tendon graft, the bone on the kneecap was painful forever in terms of, like, getting on my knees, like, training from my knees, doing doing certain positions and even just stretching. Like, you know, putting my knees on the ground, sitting on my heels and then laying back, it was freaking painful. It took forever to break all that scar tissue up, and now it's fine.

[01:18:00]
It's fine now.

[01:18:01]
Yeah. I mean It's

[01:18:02]
a long time ago.

[01:18:03]
Yeah. I can kinda do everything that I want at this point. It's still, like, a little sore, but I I I don't know. I think that it's supposed to be a couple years until you, like, feel like it's full. I think it takes some time for the nerves to grow into it and all that.

[01:18:14]
Did you incorporate peptides in your recovery?

[01:18:17]
I I didn't.

[01:18:19]
Do you hate healing?

[01:18:20]
Do I hate healing? No.

[01:18:22]
I didn't use peptides.

[01:18:23]
I don't know. I just took my doctor's advice on it.

[01:18:25]
Yeah. But don't do that anymore.

[01:18:27]
I mean,

[01:18:28]
next time No. There's other people to talk to.

[01:18:31]
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's it's going pretty well. It's going pretty well. I'm sure

[01:18:34]
it goes pretty well, but it would go quicker with peptides. 100%.

[01:18:38]
For sure.

[01:18:38]
But it's been this interesting

[01:18:40]
opportunity to, like, like, I really don't want that to happen again. So I I feel like I'm so much more focused on technique. Like, the first time that I learned all this stuff, I was like, I was probably, like, a little too brutish about it and and just, like, muscling through stuff. And now, I don't know. Now I feel like I'm, like, really learning how to do this stuff correctly, and I can do it way more effortlessly.

[01:19:05]
So it's it's,

[01:19:06]
That's the goal. How did it pop? How did it pop?

[01:19:09]
I was I was, like, the end of a session, and, through 2 hours into training, and I was doing, like, a few rounds. And, and I basically, I threw a leg kick, and the other guy went to check it. And I, like, leaned back to try to get around the check and just put too much torque on my knee. Mhmm. So it was the planted leg.

[01:19:27]
But, Mine was a planted leg too. Yeah. But it's I don't know. Dave was, like, you know before that round, Dave was like, you're done. I'm like, no.

[01:19:35]
1 more round.

[01:19:36]
You know? So you're too tired as well.

[01:19:38]
Yeah. And and I'd and I and I basically and I hadn't, you know, I I basically had also just done a really hard kind of, like, leg workout the day before.

[01:19:50]
But I don't

[01:19:51]
think the the but the fight guys didn't know that. So I I I really just pushed it too hard.

[01:19:55]
Are you aware of, knees over toes guy? Yeah. Have you done his stuff?

[01:20:00]
I've I've looked at it a bunch. I mean, the rehab thing I took really seriously, I thought that was pretty interesting too. Mhmm. That's, I don't wanna, like, have to do a lot of rehabs like this 1. But to do 1 of them, I actually thought it was a pretty interesting experience because it's, like, week over week, you're just getting back so much mobility and Mhmm.

[01:20:17]
And ability to do stuff. And Yeah. No. I feel like I'm, I don't know. At this point, I just, like like, probably half my weight training is is effectively kind of, like, rehab and joint health stuff.

[01:20:32]
And, like, wrists, shoulders, knee, all that in addition to the big muscle groups.

[01:20:37]
Yeah. That's very smart. The knee over toes guy stuff is particularly effective because it it all comes from a guy that had a series of pretty catastrophic knee injuries and was plagued with weak knees his whole life. And then developed a bunch of different methods to strengthen all the supporting muscles around the knee that are really extraordinary. Everything from Nordic curls.

[01:21:00]
Do you do those? Do you do Nordic curls?

[01:21:03]
I should. I should do more than I do.

[01:21:05]
Yeah. Leg curls, Nordic curls, but Nordic curls in particular because, you know, you it's very difficult to do.

[01:21:10]
You you got your

[01:21:11]
body Yeah. You lift your whole body up with your hamstrings. Yeah. And all these different, slant board squats and different lunges and split squats and all these different things which, like, really strengthen up all the supporting muscles around the knee better than anything that I've ever tried before. And he's got, like, a whole program where it scales up and he puts it online for everybody.

[01:21:34]
Yeah. And he gives away a lot of information for free because he said, look, look, when I was 11 years old, I wish I had access to this. So I'm gonna put it out there for everybody. Great guy. Mhmm.

[01:21:43]
Yeah. Cool. But I can't recommend that stuff enough. But I think what you're doing is like strengthening shoulders, strengthening that's really the way to do it. Like, you have to think of muscles in terms of like armor, you know.

[01:21:54]
If you wanna do this thing, you know, it's better to have good bumpers around your car if you might bump into other cars. Mhmm.

[01:21:59]
You know,

[01:21:59]
you don't wanna just have raw sheet metal, you know?

[01:22:03]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and I think a lot of people just focus on, like, the big movements and and weight training. Mhmm.

[01:22:10]
It's I don't know. First of all, for, like, a lot of fighting type stuff, you you kinda wanna be loose and, like, not super tight. So, but, yeah, I mean, I I just think, like, the the joint stability stuff is you get older and and wanna do this for a longer period of time. It's it's good to do.

[01:22:26]
Yeah. It's huge. It's, mobility in general. It's just, like, so important.

[01:22:30]
You can compete in jujitsu for a long time. Sure. There's, like, all these masters divisions and stuff and yeah. Just those

[01:22:36]
old crazy looking 7 year old dudes trying

[01:22:37]
to kill each other. Yeah. It's

[01:22:38]
nuts. It's great. It is great but for real sincerely, we're very happy. The the I think I could speak rarely do but I think I could speak for the martial arts community. We're very happy that you're bored.

[01:22:51]
It just it makes it it makes it fun that someone is, you know, a prominent intellectual, very intelligent person who's really gotten fascinated by it because it does help to kill that sort of knuckle dragger perspective that a lot of people have about the sport.

[01:23:06]
No. I I think it's super intellectual in terms of actually breaking this stuff down. I mean, both jujitsu and, like, striking. I mean, it's yeah. You don't have time to think, but, like, the reasoning behind why you kind of wanna slip in certain ways and, like, the probability game that you're playing Mhmm.

[01:23:25]
Is, I don't know. I used defense when I was in high school, and I did that pretty competitively. I was never, like, quite good enough to be, like, at the Olympic level, but I was pretty good. And, we virtual fenced last time you were here. Yeah.

[01:23:39]
There we go. And and, like, I, you know, I just remember I would, like, sit in my clbuttes in high school and, like, sketch out combinations of moves and sequences for how to, like, faint and, like, and and kinda trick someone to get them out of position to be able to tap them. And it's, I I I feel like this is like a game in the same way. Mhmm. Right?

[01:24:06]
It's like I mean, I think when when you're training, you're not, like, slugging at each other that much. You're just like you're, you know, playing tag.

[01:24:11]
Yeah. You're playing tag. Well, the way the Thais do it, I think, is the best. And they're obviously some of the best fighters ever. They fight a lot, which is 1 of the reasons why they train the way they train.

[01:24:20]
But when you talk to people that train over there, they're like, you learn so much more when you're playing. You know, when you're doing it, when you're not trying to hurt each other.

[01:24:29]
You know,

[01:24:29]
then you really do learn the technique, like and it gets fully ingrained in your system. Yeah.

[01:24:35]
It's great.

[01:24:36]
Yeah. You just have to be careful brain damage. Like, you were talking about having an MMA fight. Are you still entertaining that?

[01:24:41]
I I want to. I mean, this is my thing. It's like and I I think I probably will, but we'll we'll see. I mean, it's 2025, I think, is gonna be a very busy year on the AI side. Yeah.

[01:24:54]
And I don't like, I I think the idea of having a competition, you really need to, like, get into the headspace of, like, I'm gonna fight someone this week. Mhmm. And, so I need to I need to figure this out because I don't I don't know how with everything that's going on in AI, I'm gonna have, like, a week or 2 where I can just get into this, like, I'm gonna go fight someone. But but it's good it's good training. But and I I would like to at some point.

[01:25:19]
You know, the thing about the ACL injury is I I kind of thought before this, it's like, alright. I'm gonna do some jujitsu competitions. I wanna do 1 MMA fight, like, 1 kind of, like, pro or competitive MMA fight. And then I figured I'd go back to jujitsu, but I think tearing the ACL striking is a little more of a fluke. I think you're much more likely to do that grappling.

[01:25:39]
So going through the ACL experience didn't make me wanna, like, just exclusively go do the version where you're just attacking joints all day long. Right? So Mhmm. I'm like, alright. We can take a few more punches to the face before we go back to that.

[01:25:54]
You can hurt yourself doing both of them. You know? You there's really no rhyme or reason. I blew my left ACLs kickboxing, my right ACL jujitsu.

[01:26:02]
Okay. And that's So equal opportunity.

[01:26:04]
Yeah. I mean, this this, like, Tom Aspinall famously blew his out against Curtis Blaydes with the supporting leg just for

[01:26:10]
a kick

[01:26:10]
and his Yeah. It's freak accidents. Yeah. Weird things happen. You're it's a lot of explosive force with striking, and sometimes that tears things more than slow, controlled movements of jujitsu, especially if you have good training partners.

[01:26:23]
Yeah. But jujitsu isn't always slower controlled

[01:26:25]
Nope. When

[01:26:26]
you're especially when you're competing.

[01:26:27]
No. Especially when you're competing. Unless you're really, really good. Like, you ever watch Gordon? Like, Gordon never moves fast.

[01:26:34]
He doesn't have to. He doesn't have to move fast. He's just, like, always a step ahead of everybody. Have you talked to him at all? Oh, yeah.

[01:26:40]
Did you talk to John Donahue?

[01:26:43]
No. I haven't. You need to talk to him? Yeah. No.

[01:26:44]
I I would be interested in that.

[01:26:45]
That's the greatest mind in combat sports. Now Gordon is the 1 that says I don't say that lightly. John Donahue is the greatest mind in combat sports

[01:26:53]
Interesting.

[01:26:53]
By far. He's a legitimate genius. You know the whole story. Right? The guy was a professor of philosophy at Stanford and just or Columbia?

[01:27:01]
Where was he? I forgot. The Columbia, I think it was.

[01:27:04]
Columbia.

[01:27:04]
And then decides, I'm just gonna teach jiu jitsu all day. Sleeps on the math, teaches all day long, you know. Where's a rash guard anywhere he goes? He's a freak and he's so freaking smart, like, scary smart about all kinds of things. It's not just jujitsu.

[01:27:18]
You know, he's got a a memory like a steel vice, like, he just holds on to thoughts and can repeat them. His recall's insane. He's a a legitimate genius that became obsessed with jujitsu. And what he's done with Gordon and with Gary Toonen and, you know, just a series of other athletes is nothing short of extraordinary. You know?

[01:27:41]
Just an interesting guy to have conversations with too. Have you seen him on Lexus Show? He's done a couple

[01:27:46]
episodes of Lexus. And I watched I I saw the 1 that you did with him

[01:27:50]
too. Love the guy. Yeah. Because, I mean, again, happy there's someone like that that out there. Because when people have these ideas of what martial arts are and then you see a guy like that, you're like, okay.

[01:28:01]
Why? I might have to rethink this.

[01:28:03]
Yeah. There's a there's a whole spectrum of people.

[01:28:06]
Yeah. What has it done in terms of a lot of 1 of the things that a lot of people said and I have too, like, nothing turns you into a libertarian quicker than jiu jitsu.

[01:28:15]
I don't

[01:28:16]
know why that is. I I think it's a hard work thing. It's cutting out all of the bullshoot and realizing how much of the things that we take as real things are just excuses and bullshoot and weakness and just to procrastinate. There's a lot of things that we have that exist, especially in like the business world, in the corporate world, in the education world that are just bullshoot. And they don't really have to be there.

[01:28:40]
Mhmm. And they're only there to try to make up for hard work.

[01:28:43]
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's kinda just what I what I was saying before. I think the for me, it's, just I think a lot of the corporate world is is, like, pretty culturally neutered.

[01:29:03]
And and I I I just think, like, having you know, I I grew up I have 3 sisters, no brothers. I have 3 daughters, no sons. So I'm, like, surrounded by girls and women, like, my my whole life. And it's like so I think, I don't know. There's there's something the the the kind of masculine energy, I think, is is good.

[01:29:24]
And Yeah. Obviously, you know, society has plenty of that, but but I think corporate culture was really, like, trying to get away from it. And I do think that there's just something it's like I don't know. The these all these forms of energy are good, and I think having a culture that, like, celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive. And that's that has been that has been a kind of a positive experience for me.

[01:29:56]
Just, like, having a thing that I can just, like, do with my guy friends and, like Yeah. And it's just, like, we just, like, beat each other a bit. I don't know. It's it's good. It is good.

[01:30:06]
I agree. I don't know.

[01:30:07]
It's good. It just I I could see your point, though, about Yeah. Corporate culture. How when do you think that happened? Was that a slow shift?

[01:30:16]
Because I think it used to be very masculine. And I used to be I think it was kind of hyper aggressive at 1 point

[01:30:21]
in time. Look. And I think part of the the intent on all these things, I think, is good. Right? It's I like, I do think that if you're a a woman going into a company, it probably feels like it's too masculine.

[01:30:32]
It's like there isn't enough of the kind of the energy that that that you may naturally have, and it probably feels like there are all these things that are set up that are biased against you. And that's not good either because you want you want women to be able to succeed and Right. And, like, have companies that can unlock all the value from having great people no matter, you know, what their background or gender. You know? So but but I think these things can all always go a little far.

[01:30:54]
And I think it's 1 thing to say we wanna be kind of, like, welcoming and make a good environment for everyone, and I think it's another to basically say that masculinity is bad. And I I just think we kind of swung culturally to that part of the the kind of

[01:31:10]
Mhmm.

[01:31:11]
The spectrum where, you know, it's all like, okay. Masculinity is toxic. We have to, like, get rid of it completely. It's like, no. Like, it's both of these things are good.

[01:31:19]
Right? It's like you want, like, feminine energy. You want masculine energy. Like, I I think that that's like, you're gonna have parts of society that have more of 1 or the other. I think that that's all good.

[01:31:29]
But, but I do think the corporate culture sort of had swung towards being this somewhat more neutered thing. And I didn't really feel that until I got involved in martial arts, which I think is still a more much more masculine culture. And, so and not not that it doesn't try to be inclusive in its own way, but, but I think that there's just a lot more of that energy there. And I just kind of realized it's like, oh, this

[01:32:01]
is like how you become successful at martial arts. You have to be at least somewhat aggressive.

[01:32:06]
Yeah. So Yeah. But but yeah. I mean, there are these things there are, like, a few of these things throughout your life where you just you have an experience, and you're like, where has this been my whole life? And it just, like, it it just turned on, like, a part of my brain that I was like, okay.

[01:32:20]
Yeah. Like, this was this was a piece of the puzzle that should've been there, and I'm glad it now is.

[01:32:27]
That I felt that way when I started hunting.

[01:32:29]
Oh, yeah. Hunting too.

[01:32:30]
Yeah. Same kind of thing. You've so you've done a lot of that as well.

[01:32:33]
Yeah. Well so, I mean, we have this ranch out in Kauai, and there's invasive pigs. And we on our ranch, we have, there's a lot of albatross. I don't know if they're endangered or just threatened. And then there's the Hawaiian state bird, the, the nene goose is, that's, I think, endangered or or at least was until recently, and, like, most of them in the world live in a small stretch, or at least most of them on Kauai live in a small stretch that includes our ranch.

[01:33:03]
So you constantly have these pigs that are just, like, multiply so quickly, and we basically have to apply pressure to to the population or else they just get overrun and threaten the birds and the other wildlife. And so and what I basically explained to my daughters, who I also want to learn how to do this, because I just feel like it's like, look. We we have this land. We take care of it. Just like you mow the grbutt, we need to make sure that these populations are in check.

[01:33:30]
It's part of what we do as, like, the stewards of this, and, we've gotta do it. And then if you if you have to kill something, then you should, you know, obviously, treat it with respect and, you know, use the the the meat to to make food and and, and and kind of celebrate in that way. But it's it's a culture that I I think it's it's just an important thing for kids to grow up, understanding, like, the circle of life. Right? So, you know, teaching, like, teaching the kids all of, you know, what is is kind of, you know, how you'd run a ranch, how you'd run a farm.

[01:34:05]
I think that that stuff it's good. I mean, because, you know, explaining to the kids what a tech company is is really abstract. Right? So for a while, my daughters were pretty convinced that my actual job was Mark's Meats, which is our, our kind of ranch and, like, the cattle that we that we ranch. I was, like, well, not quite, and you'll learn when you get older.

[01:34:29]
But, but I I think that there's something that's just, like, much more tangible about that than, you know, taking them to the office and, you know, sitting in product reviews or something for for some, like, piece of software that we're writing.

[01:34:41]
Well, it's certainly a lot more primal. Yeah. Yeah. And if you do wind up eating that meat from the animal and you were there while the animal died, like, you put it all together, like, oh, this is where meat comes from.

[01:34:53]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:34:55]
Which is another reason why things have become sort of emasculated because that energy is not necessary anymore to acquire meat. You know, that used to be the

[01:35:03]
only way that people

[01:35:04]
got meat. You had to go hunt it. So you had to go actually pull the trigger, kill the animal yourself, cut it up, butcher it, cook it. You knew what you were doing.

[01:35:13]
Yeah. Although my favorite is bow, bow and arrow. Mhmm. I mean, that's, I I think, like, the most that that feels like the most kind of sporting version of it.

[01:35:22]
Yeah. If you wanna put it that way. Yeah. I mean, if you're just trying to get meat, it's not the most effective. The most effective is certainly a rifle.

[01:35:29]
But, I prefer it because it's it requires more of you.

[01:35:35]
Yeah. And you just kinda go and hang out and Yeah.

[01:35:38]
And you have to be fit. Yeah. Especially if you're mountain hunting, you have to be really fit. Yeah. You can't just be kind of in shape.

[01:35:44]
You gotta be really fit. If you wanna huff up the mountains and keep your heart rate at a certain level so that when you get to the top, you can execute a shot calmly.

[01:35:53]
And then actually carry the thing out.

[01:35:54]
Yeah. Yeah. And carry the thing out.

[01:35:56]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. I I'm I mostly mostly use a rifle just because it's so much more efficient.

[01:36:02]
You know, your your conversion rate is so much higher, but it's, but, yeah, another What kind of bow do you have? Gosh. I didn't get to do it this season, but, do you

[01:36:15]
know the company that makes it?

[01:36:17]
Not off the top of my head.

[01:36:18]
I mean you have to know.

[01:36:19]
Yeah. No. This is embarrbutting. This is embarrbutting.

[01:36:23]
I can get you hooked up.

[01:36:24]
Yeah. I it works. Okay. Do you know how old it is? No.

[01:36:29]
It's it's not old. Okay. I think it's it's like a just a compound bow that I got strung to my draw length and

[01:36:37]
Did you get someone to coach you?

[01:36:39]
Yeah. Yeah. Who coached you? It's basically a bunch of the guys who who, you know, help run security around the ranch.

[01:36:46]
Okay. Yeah. The thing about archery is just like martial arts, 1 of the things that I learned when I was teaching is that it's way easier to teach someone that knows nothing than to teach someone who learned something incorrectly. The people who learned something incorrectly. The moment, things got tense and they panicked, they went back to the old ways, because it's sort of ingrained in their system.

[01:37:10]
So archery, 1 of the things that's very important is proper form and then proper execution, especially having a surprise shot. And learning how to have a surprise shot is

[01:37:22]
What what do you mean?

[01:37:23]
Yeah. See. You don't know.

[01:37:25]
No. See, that's not

[01:37:26]
this is the thing. In high pressure situations, 1 of the most important things is to have, a shot process where you don't know exactly when the arrow is going off. You just have a process where you're pulling through the shot and the shot breaks. So it's a surprise shot. So you put the pin on the target.

[01:37:46]
Mhmm. I use a a thumb trigger. I use a Yeah.

[01:37:49]
I do too.

[01:37:50]
I use a thing called an onyx clicker.

[01:37:52]
Okay.

[01:37:52]
And the reason why I use the onyx clicker is like a hinge. It gives you a 2 stage of the trigger. Right? So as I'm at full draw, I put slight pressure and I hear a click. And that click means it's ready to go off with more pressure.

[01:38:06]
So I've gone through stage 1. Now stage 2 is just concentrating on the shot process and knowing it's gonna break. And then there's no flinching. There's no tweak. There's no there's no other thing that people do when they have a a finger trigger where they they twitch because your your body is anticipating the shock of the bow.

[01:38:26]
And when you're doing that, you can be off by 6 inches, 4 inches, 5 inches, all over the place because you're moving. You're moving while you're you're shooting. When you're doing it with a rifle, it's very different because, obviously, a rifle's far faster.

[01:38:39]
Yeah.

[01:38:40]
And then you have a scope. So you're, you know, you're you're zoomed in many magnifications and all you have to do is just slowly squeeze. And if you're smart, you'll be prone or you'll have your rifle rested on a tripod or something where you have a good steady. It's much easier. With a bow, it's very different because you're holding with your arms so you have to have the proper form, you have to have the proper posture, and then there's this thought process.

[01:39:03]
And my friend Joel Turner who is a, sniper created a whole system for people called ShotIQ. Mhmm. He's got this whole online system of developing the proper execution of a shot. When you see, like, tournament archers when they go to Vegas so what a Vegas tournament is, you have 3 targets and they have to shoot 30 arrows at a time. So they shoot 10 in this 1, 10 in that 1, 10 in this 1.

[01:39:29]
And the really good archers score an x every time. So in the they're in the center or close to the center. They're hitting the 10 ring every arrow for 30 arrows in a row, and then there's round after round, another 30 hours with new people, another 30 and if you miss slightly, you get a 9, that's it. You're done. Because all these other guys are not gonna get a 9.

[01:39:49]
Very rarely will they. You know? So most it's the the most tens that you can get, and the best way to do that is with a surprise shot. So these guys have, like, these long stabilizers on their bow where they keep it totally steady, and it's all just about relaxing. And most of them use a hinge release.

[01:40:07]
Or so a hinge you know what a hinge is? Have you ever used 1? Okay. Instead of a button Mhmm. You press it Mhmm.

[01:40:13]
You're rotating the hinge, which activates the shield.

[01:40:17]
I just have a trigger.

[01:40:18]
Yeah. Yeah. So you're just hammering the trigger. You're doing exactly what you're not supposed to do. You're a trigger puncher.

[01:40:22]
Yeah. You're a trigger puncher.

[01:40:23]
With your thumb?

[01:40:24]
Yeah. You're you're hitting it with your thumb. Right? Uh-huh. Yeah.

[01:40:26]
I guarantee you, when you do it, your arm doesn't move. You go like this. Like that. Uh-huh. So with a good surprise shot, you shouldn't know it's gonna go off.

[01:40:33]
You're pulling. And then once the trigger breaks off, your arm will naturally go backwards because you're not anticipating the shot.

[01:40:41]
I'm definitely not doing that.

[01:40:42]
Yeah. See, that's the thing. You're like

[01:40:43]
But how how far away are you shooting things from?

[01:40:46]
It depends. That elk out there, the photograph that's in the front, that 1 I shot, it's, in the front of the building when you walk in before you go into the studio. There's a an a mounted head and then a photograph of me and my friend Cam. That 1 was 67 yards. I shot 1 at 79 yards once, but that's rare.

[01:41:04]
Most of the time, it's like, for me, my effective range, my like, where I'd like to be is 60 yards and in.

[01:41:11]
Yeah. Because I was gonna say, I don't think I've ever shot something more than 50 yards out. Yeah. It's hard. Yeah.

[01:41:17]
So so I think that

[01:41:18]
really, you know, real your form has to be tight. You have to be really confident. You have to have a lot of arrows down range. And then you have to be able to stay calm during the shot. So now imagine if you're shooting something at 18 yards.

[01:41:30]
Okay? And you hammer the trigger. A little bit of this, a little bit of that, you're still gonna get there. Yeah. Right?

[01:41:35]
Because it's only 18 yards. So the the amount of deviation off the path that it takes in 18 yards is significantly different than the amount of deviation a 105 yards. It's a huge gap. It might be 2 feet to the right. Yeah.

[01:41:48]
Meanwhile, you thought you were shooting accurately because you're inside of, like, a pie plate at 20 yards. And the difference between that is form, technique, and a shot execution process, and also management of the psychology of the shot. Because this is 1 moment. Here it comes. Yeah.

[01:42:06]
Here it comes now.

[01:42:08]
Mhmm.

[01:42:08]
And if you only do that once a year, like, say if you go on 1 big elk hunt a year, you save up all your money, you get your gear all ready, you get your arrows weighed, you practice, and then you're in the mountains for 10 days. And on 11th day, you get this animal that moves. It's at 57 yards and stands there, and you're like, your heart's beating. You just might hammer that trigger. You just might hammer it.

[01:42:31]
So you have to have this shot process and where you you're literally talking to yourself inside your head. You have words that you say that occupy your thoughts while you're going through the shot process so that you never get overcome by shot panic. Interesting. Because target panic is a giant thing in the archery community. It's giant.

[01:42:52]
Even saying it is like saying Voldemort. It's like, don't say it. People don't wanna say it. It's like saying Candyman. Like, people don't like it because it it freaks people out.

[01:43:02]
Like, the they'll dig some people can't keep their pin on the target. They have to keep their pin below the target and then they raise it up to the target. When it gets where the target is, they hammer the trigger because they're just freaking out. Yeah. Have you ever experienced that?

[01:43:17]
I mean, I've missed, if that's what you're asking. I I haven't analyzed it this level of detail. But no. I mean, there are a lot of bores on our ranch, so I guess I don't I don't get yeah. And, also, like, we have a range, and and we, I don't know.

[01:43:33]
We set up bowling pins and, you know, it's like we shoot pistols at the bowling pins, but I also like just like I I I'm usually faster at taking down all the bowling pins with a bow and arrow than most of my friends are with the pistol, which I think is is is pretty fun. But yeah. No. I mean, just more casual. I'm I'm clearly not doing it at your level, and then maybe you've given me another, side quest to maybe go deeper on.

[01:43:55]
But That's

[01:43:55]
what I'm saying.

[01:43:56]
But I I'll take you on

[01:43:57]
an elk hunt in the mountains. Yeah. You'll get addicted. I do think about I do think the dynamic

[01:44:03]
that you're talking about, though, where if you only see 1 animal on a multi day, then, like, that is just way higher stakes than anything that I'm doing. I mean, I'd say not everything

[01:44:14]
that you're doing. Because if you're really considering having an MMA fight, it's very similar. Because you're building up to this

[01:44:19]
1 moment. Sure. I'm talking about the archery that I'm doing. Right. I mean, it's like, I go out.

[01:44:23]
It's like, you're gonna see some pigs, and, like, and it's like, if I don't if I don't hit any, it's like, my family's still eating. It's okay. You know? So I'm not like, you know, but Right.

[01:44:32]
Yeah. But if it's like martial arts is what I'm saying. It's like, you really should learn it the right way from the beginning.

[01:44:38]
You can verify I've clearly not learned this in a very rigorous way. I'll hook you up. Yeah. I can get people to come in. A video on Instagram once of me, I I think, hitting bowling pins with archery.

[01:44:49]
And, like, all the comments are like, man, your form is shoot. So, so I think it checks out with the conversation that we're having now.

[01:44:56]
Well, the the issue with that is that you're reading the comments. Like You should never read comments.

[01:45:00]
That's fair. That's fair.

[01:45:02]
I've never had anything good come out of reading comments.

[01:45:05]
Yeah. Although, I don't know. It's pretty funny. I think the just, like, getting the the the gist and the summary of it, I think, is is is pretty funny.

[01:45:13]
Yeah. It's funny. It's just not mentally healthy.

[01:45:16]
Yeah. No. You can't spend too much time on it.

[01:45:17]
I don't spend any time on it. Yeah. I'd I'm a much happier person since I, like, avoided comments. Yeah. It's just too weird.

[01:45:24]
You're just delving into the world of all these people's mental illness and screaming at people and just, I don't I don't want anything to do with it.

[01:45:31]
Yeah. But, I mean, I I do read my friends' comments, and when even they're, like, man, that's ugly. Like, that's I do that.

[01:45:38]
I do that, and I shouldn't do that. But I definitely don't send them to them. Hey, bro. Did you see this?

[01:45:43]
Those guys are the worst.

[01:45:45]
Guys that'll send things to you that are about you. You're like, hey, man. Don't. I'm not looking for that. Don't send it to me.

[01:45:50]
I don't I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Social media is it's like what a weird new pressure, you know. And children today are going through some bizarre stress that we've never had to go through before.

[01:46:03]
And a bizarre sort of, just disconnect from physical reality by most of your communication being electronic.

[01:46:12]
Yeah. And I think, you know, we basically my kids at this point are 9, 7, and, and 1a half.

[01:46:20]
So we got So you're not interested in that? Or you're not No.

[01:46:22]
No. I I would rather of

[01:46:23]
course, you're interested. I mean, interested. I mean, involved. We're very

[01:46:26]
focused on it. We would now. I think that it's about to start getting a lot more complicated. Mhmm. I think, you know, the 9 and and 7 year old.

[01:46:33]
But, I mean, just kind of deciding what technology they're gonna use and what's good and what's not and Mhmm. All the dynamics around that. It's, it's, it's really complicated. I and then, look. I mean, I think every family has their own values in how they wanna approach this.

[01:46:50]
Right? So from my perspective, you know, our we have 1 of my daughters just, like, loves building stuff. So she clearly, like, takes after me in this way. It's like, every day, she's just, like, creating some random thing. It's like she's creating stuff with Legos and, you know, it's like, 1 day it's that or, you know, the next day it's Minecraft.

[01:47:10]
And from my perspective, it's like, okay. I don't know. Minecraft is actually kind of a cooler tool to build stuff than than Legos a lot of the way. So it's, you know, it's am I gonna say that there's gonna there there there needs to be some kind of limit on on her screen time if if she's doing something that's creative, that's maybe, like, a richer form of what she would have been doing physically? Right.

[01:47:30]
In that case, probably not. Now there were times when, she'd get so excited about what she was building in Minecraft or or something that she was coding in Scratch that she'd wake up early to kinda get her tablet. And that was bad, right, because then it's, like, starting to get in the way of her sleep. And I'm like, you know, August, you you can't do that. Right?

[01:47:50]
It's like we're gonna take your your iPad away if you're doing that. You little psycho. Wait. Don't get up early. No.

[01:47:56]
It's like it's like August. I did that too when I was a kid, but trust me

[01:48:01]
Yeah.

[01:48:02]
You're gonna wanna sleep.

[01:48:02]
It's not gonna lead to success meanwhile you're on a freaking island.

[01:48:05]
Yeah. No. It's yeah. It's 1

[01:48:08]
of the richest people in the world. Your dad like, what the freak, dad?

[01:48:12]
Yeah.

[01:48:12]
Didn't it work for you?

[01:48:13]
I mean, you know

[01:48:14]
Leave me alone, my iPad. I'm trying to figure out how to build a a mansion and

[01:48:17]
Yeah. My crap. It's either gonna work or it's gonna end badly. But Right. But it's like but I feel like, like building stuff, I feel generally pretty good about.

[01:48:27]
Mhmm.

[01:48:27]
I think communication, I generally feel pretty good about the kids using. I mean, they use it to talk to their grandparents, right, or parents and

[01:48:34]
Mhmm.

[01:48:34]
Cousins. You know, it's like that that type of stuff is good. The Messenger Kids, the thing that we built, is basically like a messaging service that the parents can choose who can contact the kids and, like, just approve every contact. Mhmm. That's much better than just having, like, an open texting service.

[01:48:50]
But I don't know, but there's a lot of stuff that's, like, pretty sketchy. And I kinda think, like, different parents are gonna have different lines on what they want their kids to be able to do and not. Yeah. You know, so some people might not even want their kids to be able to message even with friends when they're 9 and 7. Some people might say, hey.

[01:49:06]
No. Minecraft, that's just a game. I don't think about that as building. I think that is a game. I wanna limit the time that you're doing that.

[01:49:11]
I want you to go read books instead or whatever whatever the the values are that that family has. So for Meta, what we've kinda come to is we wanna be the most aligned with parents on giving parents the tools that they need to basically control how the experiences work for their kids. Now we don't even really, except for, like, stuff like Messenger Kids, we don't even have our services, our apps generally available to people under the age of 13 at all. So, I mean, our kids, I haven't had to, like, have the conversation about when when they get Instagram or Facebook or any of that stuff. But, but when they turn 13, we basically want parents to be able to have complete control over the kids' experience.

[01:49:54]
And that's you know, we just rolled out this Instagram teens thing, which is it's a set of of controls where, you know, it's if you if you're an older teen, we'll just default you into the private experience. That way, you're not getting, like, harbutted or bombarded with stuff. And, but if you're a younger teen, then you have to get your parents' permission, and and they actually have to, like, sign in and and do all the stuff in order to make it so that you can connect with people who are beyond your network or, if you wanna kinda be a public figure, like, all all these different kinds of things. So I think that that's probably, from a values perspective, where we should be is just trying to, like, be an ally of parents. But but it is complicated stuff.

[01:50:33]
I mean, it's every family wants to do it differently.

[01:50:36]
It is complicated, and there's also this dismissal of activities that are done electronically as not being beneficial. And 1 of the things that we highlighted recently was a study that we found online that showed that surgeons that play video games

[01:50:49]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:50]
Make far less mistakes.

[01:50:52]
Interesting. Yeah. Well, the people who do the training in VR definitely make less mistakes.

[01:50:56]
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, that is, to me Yeah. 1 of the most fascinating aspects of technology today. You know, when you and I were doing that, game or fencing with each other, I'm like, this could be applied to so many different things now.

[01:51:11]
It's like the there's so many opportunities, not just for just pure recreation, but education. There's so many things you could learn skills through AR or VR Mhmm.

[01:51:24]
That it

[01:51:25]
you're it's it'll greatly enhance your ability to do those things in the real world. I mean, it's a it's a real it's kind of a cheat code in a lot of ways. And it's also games in VR. I I don't know if you ever done sandbox. You ever do sandbox?

[01:51:40]
Which

[01:51:40]
You know sandbox VR? Do you know what that company is?

[01:51:42]
Yeah. You go

[01:51:43]
to a warehouse, you put on a haptic feedback test. Yeah. You shoot zombies. Yeah. I'm so addicted.

[01:51:48]
I'm so addicted. It is my favorite thing. There's a thing called Deadwood Mansion. It's the most fun game of all time by far. You have a shotgun, and there's zombies coming at you.

[01:51:59]
I want you

[01:51:59]
to catch me. My my zombie game is Arizona Sunshine.

[01:52:02]
Oh, is that 1?

[01:52:03]
0, it's it's you just like it's can be multiplayer, and there's horde mode where you just get in there, and they're, like, 4 friends, and there's just, like, waves of zombies come, and you're killing them all.

[01:52:14]
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I have to try it. Yeah. I haven't tried that 1 yet.

[01:52:17]
That's my it's very therapeutic. You just wait until they come into point blank range.

[01:52:22]
How long before you guys develop some sort of a haptic feedback suit where, like, it covers the whole body?

[01:52:27]
Oh, man. Is that possible? It's possible. I think that there's other things that are probably more important to deliver. So, I guess, taking a step back.

[01:52:42]
A lot of how we think about the goal here is delivering, like, a realistic sense of presence. Right? No technology today gives you the feeling as if you're, like, physically there with another person. Right? You're you're, like, interacting with them through a phone.

[01:52:55]
You have this, like, little window. It's kinda taking you away from everything. And that's, like, the magic of augmented and virtual reality is, like, you actually feel this, like, presence. Like, you're there with another person.

[01:53:06]
And Right.

[01:53:07]
So the question is, okay. How do you do that? And it's like there's, like, a million things that that contribute to that. I mean, obviously, first, just being able to look around and have the the room stay. Getting good spatial audio.

[01:53:19]
Right? If someone speaks, then it should give the audio need it needs to be 3 d and come from the place where they're speaking. It's actually it's very interesting which things end up being important for the this kind of creating the sense of presence and which don't. So having hands, obviously, if you're just looking around, but you can't actually, like, move things, that that that breaks the illusion. But having hands, like, hand tracking that you can do stuff is important.

[01:53:46]
1 thing that we found that's kinda funny is it's actually not that important that you see your arms. You just need to see your hands. Obviously, seeing your arms is a bonus unless we incorrectly interpolate where your elbows are or something. So if we have if we're looking at your hand or we if we have a controller, we can know, okay. Your hand is here.

[01:54:06]
But that doesn't necessarily tell us where your elbow is. So your arm could be like this. It could be like this. So we can kinda guess from the but if we get that wrong and you, like, see in VR, it's like, you see the hand there and your elbow is like looks like it's here when it's actually out there. You're like, ah, what what's going on?

[01:54:21]
Like, that's messed up. So it's a lot of these things. Like, you just don't wanna get these details wrong. So haptics, the most important first thing for haptics is on the hand. Right?

[01:54:32]
I mean, we have so many more, the neurons, basically, and or, not neurons, but just like the the like, sensation. It's it's, like, such higher resolution, on your on your fingertips than anywhere else in the body. So, you know, when you grab something, you know, making it so that you feel some pushback. Right? When you there's a lot of gaming systems at this point where if you, like, pull a trigger, you get, like, a little bit of a rumble or something.

[01:54:58]
We built this 1 thing

[01:55:01]
where it's

[01:55:01]
like a ping pong paddle with a sensor in it, and it you you feel the ball hit like, the virtual ball hitting the ping pong paddle. Mhmm. And it feels like like, when you're actually playing ping pong, it doesn't it's not like a generic thing where it just, like, you feel it hit the paddle. You feel where it hits the paddle. Mhmm.

[01:55:21]
Then we basically built a system where now with this, like, physical paddle, you can kind of it the the haptics make it so you can feel where the ball hits the paddle. Oh. So it's like all these things, like, are just going towards delivering a more realistic experience. So full body haptics. So there are some things that I think it could do.

[01:55:45]
Like, if you get if you're playing a boxing game, you get punched in the stomach, you can probably simulate something like that a little. It's not gonna be able to deliver that much force. So, I mean, I guess that's maybe a good thing because no 1 wants to get Right. Punched in the stomach that hard. But but, like, it's not gonna be able to deliver enough force for you to for example, let's say you're not just boxing, you're kickboxing.

[01:56:15]
Like, I don't know. You need something on the other side to be able to complete it. Right? Because it it's like when you kick, when you when you're, when you're just practicing, it's like you you you spin. Right?

[01:56:25]
Because you don't wanna just, like, stop. And it's, you know, it's like like the the shadowing of kick. Like, there's not gonna be anything that you can do as, like, a, you know, single person playing VR with a haptic suit that, like, makes it so that you're gonna be able to kick someone who's not there physically and actually be able to do that. Right. So, like, grappling, it's like I I don't I think that that like, jujitsu is gonna be the last thing that we're able to do in in in VR because you, like, need the momentum of the other person and to be able to move them.

[01:56:54]
The boxing thing is actually good. Boxing works.

[01:56:57]
Yeah. Yeah. Boxing works. Even and you don't really need the haptics. I think it would be better with it.

[01:57:03]
That's probably 1 of the better cases. I think it's that and getting shot or, like, sword fighting type stuff.

[01:57:08]
Mhmm.

[01:57:09]
So you can, like, just feel feel it on your body. But I don't know. I I think what's basically gonna end up happening is you're gonna have, like, a home setup for these things, and then you're gonna have there are these, like, location based services where, like, people, it's almost like a theme park where you can go into, and it can and you can have, like, a a really immersive VR experience where it's not just that you get, like, a a vest that can simulate some haptics. It's that you're also, like, in a real physical environment. So they can, like, have smoke come out or something, and you can smell that and feel that or, like, spray some water and it feels humid.

[01:57:47]
And, I think that it it still is gonna be a while before you can just, like, virtually create all those sensations. So I think a lot of those really rich experiences are gonna be in these very constructed environments.

[01:57:58]
Is the bridge when they figure out some sort of a neural interface? So instead of having these extraneous things, instead instead of having, like, a fan blowing at you or, you know, the ground moves a little bit, have everything happen inside your head.

[01:58:16]
Well, you know, in terms of neural interfaces, there are 2 approaches to the problem, roughly. Right? There's the kind of jacket into your brain neural interface, and then there's the risk based neural interface thing that, you know, we we showed you for Orion, the smart

[01:58:31]
glbuttes. Yeah.

[01:58:32]
And I I would guess that, you know, I think it's gonna be a while before, we're really widely deploying anything that jacks into your brain. I think that there are a lot of people who don't wanna be the early adopters of that technology. You wanna, like, wait until that's pretty mature before you get that.

[01:58:48]
For sure.

[01:58:48]
I mean, for and that's basically gonna get started in medical use cases. Right? So if someone, like, loses sensation part of their body, and now you have the ability to fix that.

[01:58:57]
Like the first Neurolink patient.

[01:58:59]
Yeah. So I I think you'll basically start with people who have pretty severe conditions, who the upside is very significant before you start, like, jacking people into play games better. Right?

[01:59:10]
Right.

[01:59:11]
But a risk based thing, I mean, that's something I mean, like, people wear stuff on their wrist all the time. Right? So, and what we basically found there, that doesn't do input to you, but it's good for giving you the ability to control a computer. Because, basically, you have all these extra neurons that go from your brain to controlling your hand. Your hand is, like, super complicated.

[01:59:33]
And there's actually all these extra pathways, because for for a bunch of reasons. Neuroplasticity in case you, like, lose the ability to use 1, they wanna be able to have others. So you want the redundancy because being able to use your hand is super important. So in normal use, we've kind of all figured out some patterns of how we send signals from our brain to our hand. And, I mean, the reality is there's, like, all these other patterns too that are unused today.

[02:00:02]
So you can put a wristband on your wrist that can measure activity across these neurons. And today, we're starting by basically measuring as you're doing as you're, like, moving your fingers. But over a few versions of this we're gonna get to is, like, you won't actually even have to move your hand. You'll just, like, trigger these neurons in opposing ways. It's like, you probably can't see right now.

[02:00:25]
It's like I'm kinda flexing something in this finger and something here. So, like, it's not actually moving, but there's some signal that the neural interface wristband, if I were wearing it, could pick up. And I just think we're gonna be we're gonna, like, have glbuttes, and we're gonna be able to be here. And I'm, like, gonna be able to, like, you know, text my wife or friends or something or text AI and, like, get an answer to something. It's like, I forgot something while we were talking.

[02:00:49]
Let me just text AI. Okay. I just did that. It's, like, did

[02:00:52]
you do it in a way? Sitting there without anyone even looking at your way.

[02:00:56]
And you have glbuttes and, like, the answer just comes into your glbuttes. I mean, for me, 1 of the 1 of the positive things when when COVID hit, everyone in software basically started working remotely for a while, because you can. Right? Software. It's like, okay.

[02:01:12]
Whatever. You don't have to be in the office. You can you can kinda be in different places. And a lot of the meetings went on to Zoom. And 1 of the best things about that, was basically you you were able to politely have all these side conversations.

[02:01:27]
Right? So it's like when you're seeing someone in person, it would be super rude if I, like, pulled out my phone and, like, just started texting someone. It would just be really weird. Right? Yeah.

[02:01:35]
But when you're, like, talking to someone online, it's like I don't know. I guess, because they either can't tell your attention because it's, like because there's not good presence or if it's just the norm. But they're like you have, like, the main group conversation. And then I was like, at least the norm for me was I could just, like, text different people on the side. It's like, okay.

[02:01:54]
What do you think at this point that this person is making in this meeting? Right. Like, in normal life, it's like, oftentimes, I'd have, you know, some discussion that I'd have to, like, sync up with people afterwards about how'd that go. But now it's like, I could just do that all at the same time. Right?

[02:02:07]
It's like you're having the group discussion, and you're having the conversations with the people about the discussion that you're having in real time. But you can only do that over Zoom. So I think being able to do that in kind of physical interactions, where you're just, like, you're interacting with people, and you can just, like, use an AI augmentation to be able to get extra context or help help you think through something, or remember something, just to be able to kind of have a better conversation, be able to, you know, not have to follow-up on something after the fact. I I think, like, it's gonna be super useful for for all these different things.

[02:02:41]
Well, it certainly can be, but I think that also opens up the opportunity for people to be even more disconnected. Because if you're sort of connected to other things while you're physically in the presence of someone so So you're having a conversation with someone, but you're also, like, searching, like, where you wanna eat that night. Uh-huh. You know, like because people are gonna use it for that as well.

[02:03:00]
Yeah. You know, I actually think it'll be a lot better on that. Because right now yeah. Because I mean, right now, we have our phones, but we're, like you know, it's like you're like, it it takes you away from, like, the physical environment around you. Mhmm.

[02:03:11]
You're you're kinda, like, sucked into this little screen. I think now in the future, our computing platform as it becomes more of, like, a glbuttes or eventually contact lens form factor is you're gonna actually the the Internet is gonna get overlaid on the physical world. So it's not like we have the physical world, and now I have all my digital stuff through this tiny little window. In the future, it'll be, okay. All my attention goes to the world.

[02:03:37]
The world consists of physical things and virtual things that are overlaid on it. Mhmm. You know, so if we wanted to, you know, play poker or something, you know, it's a, you know, we could have a physical deck of cards, or we could just have a virtual kind of hologram deck of cards and snap your hands. Here's the deck of cards. And, like, our friend who can't be here physically, like, he's here as a hologram, but he can play with the the the kind of digital deck of cards.

[02:04:02]
Also, I think, you know, let's say you're, like, doing something at work. You're working on a project. I think in the future, we'll have AI coworkers. Those people won't even they're they're not even people. They won't be able to be embodied.

[02:04:11]
So if you're having a physical meeting, you're sitting around with a bunch of people, they couldn't show up, as as, like, you know, part of the team no matter what. But I I think, like, we'll get to a point where just like your friend can show up in a hologram, and, like, your your AI colleagues will be able to also. So I I think, like, we'll basically be in this wild world where it's like like, most of the world will be physical, but there'll be this increasing amount of, like, virtual objects or people who are kinda beaming in or, like, hologramming into different things to interact in different ways. And, I actually think that natural blending of the kind of digital world and the physical is way more natural than the segmentation that we have today where it's like, you're in the physical world, and now I'm just gonna go tune it out to look at my my, like, I'm gonna access the whole digital universe through this, like, 5 inch screen.

[02:05:03]
Right.

[02:05:03]
So I don't know. It's just it seems natural to me. It's like that's this is the world. There isn't, like, a physical world and a digital world anymore. We're in, you know, 2025.

[02:05:11]
It's 1 world. Like, these these things should get blended.

[02:05:14]
God, that's such a weird concept, but it's true. I mean, that's where we're headed. We're certainly headed into deeper and deeper integration. It's not like things are moving away. You know, we're we're headed to deeper and deeper integration with technology and AI.

[02:05:29]
And it's inevitable, you know? It seems like it's just it's on this march, and there's not a lot we're gonna be able to do to stop that march. Just we gotta hope that the right people are in control of AI when it becomes God.

[02:05:41]
Or that it becomes widely available. I mean, I I kind of liked the the theory that it's only God if only kind of, like, 1 company or government controls it. Right? It's like if if you were the only person who had access to a computer and the Internet, you would have this, like, inhuman power that everyone else didn't have because you could use Google, and you could, like Right. Get access to all this stuff.

[02:06:05]
But the but then when everyone has it, it, it makes us all better, but it's also, like, kind of an even playing field. So that's kind of what we're going for with this whole open source thing is I just, like I don't think that there's gonna be, like, 1 AI. I certainly don't think that there should be 1 company that controls AI. I think you, like, want there to be a diversity of different things and a diversity of people creating different, different things with it. I mean, some of it will be kinda serious and helping you think through things.

[02:06:37]
I think, like, with anything on the Internet, a lot of it is just gonna be funny and, like, fun and content, and people are gonna create agents that are, like like, AIs that are entertaining, and they'll pbutt them around almost like content where it's, like, just like you you pbutt around, like, a reel or a video, and you're like, this thing is fun. Like, in the future, like a like a video, it's not interactive. You know, you you watch it, and you're consuming it. But I think a lot of more entertainment in the future will be inherently interactive where someone will kind of sculpt an experience or an AI, and then they'll show show someone. It's like, oh, this is funny.

[02:07:08]
But, like, it's not necessarily they're gonna interact with that AI every day. It's like, okay. It's funny for 5 minutes, and then you pbutt it along to your friends. And, so I don't know. I think I think you like I think you want the world to have all these different things.

[02:07:20]
And I think that's probably also, from my perspective, the best way to make sure that it doesn't get out of control is to make it so that it's pretty equally distributed.

[02:07:33]
I think the the problem that people have with it is not even whether or not it gets equally distributed. It's that if it becomes sentient and it goes on its own. The the the fear that people have, the general fear that we're gonna become obsolete is that human beings are essentially creating a superior version of higher intelligence that will be powered by quantum computing and connected to nuclear reactors, and it's gonna have, like, this ungodly ability to

[02:08:05]
well, first

[02:08:05]
of all, they've already shown that, AI has learned to code. I mean, this is 1 of the things that OpenAI said that they're Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's they're learning how to code their own AI. Uh-huh.

[02:08:16]
I think this year, probably in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are gonna have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid level engineer that you have at your company that can write code.

[02:08:36]
Mhmm.

[02:08:37]
And once you have that, then in the beginning, it'll be really expensive to run, and then you can get it to be more efficient. And then over time, we'll get to the point where a lot of the code in our apps and and including the AI that we generate is actually gonna be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers. But but I don't know. I I think that that'll augment the people working on it. So in my my view on this is, like, the future, people are just gonna be so much more creative, and they're gonna be freed up to do kinda crazy things.

[02:09:04]
Goes back to you know, my daughter was, like, playing with LEGOs before, and Mhmm. They kinda ran out of LEGOs. And then now she can have Minecraft and can build whatever she wants, and it's so much better. Just like I think it's the future versions of this stuff

[02:09:17]
are just gonna

[02:09:18]
be wild.

[02:09:18]
But Unquestionably. Yeah. Another concern that people have is that it's gonna eliminate a lot of jobs. Yeah. You know?

[02:09:24]
What do

[02:09:24]
you think about that? Well, I I think it's too it's too early to know exactly how it plays out. But my guess is that it'll probably create more creative jobs than it well, I I guess if you look at the history of all this stuff Mhmm. My my understanding is, like, a 100 years ago. In in I don't know if this is a 100 or a 150 years ago, but it was, like, at some point, not too far along, in in the grand scheme of things.

[02:09:55]
Like, the vast majority of people in society were farmers. Right? Because they kinda needed to be in order to create enough food for for everyone to survive. And then we turned that into a in, like, an industrial process, And now it's, like, 2% of society are farmers, and we get all the food that we need. So what did that free up everyone else to do?

[02:10:16]
Well, some of them went on to do other things that are sort of, like, creative pursuits or cultural pursuits or other jobs, and then some percent of it just went towards recreation. Right? So I think, generally, people just don't work as many hours, today as they did when back when everyone needed to farm in order to have enough food for everyone to survive. So I think that trend is sort of played out as technology has grown. And so my guess is that, like, the percent of people who will be doing stuff that's, like, physically required for humanity to survive will get to be smaller and smaller as it has.

[02:10:56]
More people will dedicate themselves to kind of creative and artistic and cultural pursuits. I think that's generally good. I think the number of hours in a week that someone will have to work in order to be able to get by will probably continue to shrink. Yet, I think people who are super engaged in what they do are going to be able to work really hard and accomplish way more than they ever could before, because they have, like, this unimaginable leverage from from having a lot more technology. So I think that that, if you just, like, fast forwarded or extrapolated out the hit the historical technological trend is what you'd get.

[02:11:33]
I think the question is what you raised, which is, is this qualitatively a different type of thing that somehow, obsolets people? But I I just think when you're asking that, it's just important to remind ourselves that, like, at every step along the way of human progress and technology, people thought that the technology that we were developing was gonna obsolete people. So maybe this time, it's really different. But I would guess that what'll happen is that the technology will get integrated into, like, everything that we do, which again is why I think it's really important that it's open source, and that it's widely available. So that way, it's not just, like, 1 company or 1 government kinda monopolizing the whole thing.

[02:12:16]
And I guess that if we do it in that way, we'll all just kind of have superpowers is my is my guess, rather than it it sort of creating some kind of a runaway thing. I mean, it's well, 1 of the things I think has been interesting, this is maybe going in a somewhat different direction than than what you're asking, not or a different take on the question, is I think 1 of the more interesting philosophical findings from the work in AI so far is, I think, people conflate a number of factors into what makes a person a person. So there's intelligence. There's will. There's consciousness, and, like, I think we kind of think about those 3 things as as if they're somehow all the same.

[02:13:09]
Right? It's like if you're intelligent, then you must also have a, like, a goal for what you're trying to do, or you must have some sort of consciousness. But I think, like, 1 of the crazier sort of philosophical results from the fact that, okay, you have, like, Meta AI or Chat GPT today, and it's just kinda sitting there, and you can ask it a question and deploy, like, a ton of intelligence to answer a question, and then it just kinda shuts itself down. Like, that's intelligence that is just sitting there without either having a will or consciousness.

[02:13:41]
Mhmm.

[02:13:42]
And, like, I just think it's not a super obvious result that that would be the case. But I think that a lot of people, they anthropomorphize this stuff. And when you're thinking about kind of science fiction, you think that, okay, you're gonna get to something that's, like, super smart. It's gonna, like, want something or, like, be able to feel. And

[02:14:03]
Well, you know that chatgpt tried to copy itself when it found out it was being shut down, tried to rewrite its code.

[02:14:10]
I I'm not sure what this is. What is this?

[02:14:13]
You weren't aware of that? Yeah. Fairly recently. Jamie pulled it up. We talked about it the other day.

[02:14:19]
It was shocking, when it was under the impression that it was going to become obsolete, they were gonna have a new version of it, and it would be shut down. It tried copying its code, and it tried rewriting its code, like, unprompted. Yeah.

[02:14:35]
I mean, it depends on what goal you give it. I mean, there are there are all these weird examples of this.

[02:14:39]
What is this? So pull up the side the the headline. AI fights back, the story of chat gpt attempting to copy itself. So this is 6 days ago. So, during controlled safety testing, chat gbt01 was tasked with achieving these objectives at all costs.

[02:14:55]
Under these conditions, the model allegedly took concerning steps, attempted to disable oversight mechanisms meant to regulate its behavior, tried to replicate its own code to avoid being replaced by newer versions, exhibited deceptive behaviors when monitoring systems intervened. Yeah. So Determinator. This is the fear. Right?

[02:15:16]
I mean I think you need to be careful with with these things, like, what guardrails you give it. If you if you're telling it, like At

[02:15:22]
all costs.

[02:15:22]
At all costs Right. Then, I mean

[02:15:24]
But this is what we're people are terrified of. Like, that a a foreign superpower like China is gonna say, achieve objectives at all costs.

[02:15:31]
Yeah. Although, the thing about so these reasoning models right? So there's, like, the the first generation of models, the they're LLMs. Right? That's what you think of as, like, ChatGPD or Meta AI or, like, the 2 most used ones.

[02:15:44]
And, that's basically it's sort of like a chatbot. Right? You ask it a question. It takes the prompt. It gives you a response.

[02:15:51]
Now these the next generation of reasoning models are basically, instead of just having 1 response, they now are able to build out, like, a whole tree of how they would they would respond. So you give it a question, and it instead of running 1 query, it's sort of maybe it's running a 1,000 queries or a 1,000,000 queries to kinda map out who are the things that I could do. And if I do that, then here's what I could do next. So it's a lot more kind of expensive to run, but also gets you better reasoning and is is more intelligent. That stuff, I think you do need to be very careful about how you how you like, what the guardrails are that you give it.

[02:16:34]
Mhmm.

[02:16:35]
But it's also, I think, the case that, at least for the next, you know, period, it's gonna take a lot of compute to run those models and do a lot of the stuff that they're talking about. So I don't know. I I think 1 of the interesting questions is, like, how much of this are you gonna actually be able to do on a pair of glbuttes or on a phone versus is, like, a government or a company that has, like, a whole data center gonna be able to do? And that'll I mean, it'll always get efficient. So, you know, it's like you can start doing something, and then maybe the next year, you can do it 10 times more efficiently.

[02:17:08]
But but that's certainly the next set of things that needs to get worked on in the industry, making sure that goes well.

[02:17:15]
Yeah. And then what if that gets attached to quantum computing?

[02:17:21]
I'm not really an expert on quantum computing. My understanding is that's still quite a ways off from being a, like, a a very useful paradigm. I think Google just had some breakthrough, but I I think most people still think that's, like, a decade plus out. So my guess is we're gonna have pretty smart AIs even, even before that. But yeah.

[02:17:46]
I mean look. I mean, I I think that this stuff has to get it needs to be developed thoughtfully. Right? But but I don't know. I I still think we're we're generally just gonna be better off in a world where this is, like, deployed pretty evenly and, you know, it's I guess here's another analogy that I think about.

[02:18:07]
There's, like, bugs and security holes in basically every software, every piece of software that everyone uses. So if you could go back in time a few years, knowing the security holes that we're now aware of, you as an individual could basically, like, break into any system. AI will be able to do that too. It'll be able to probe and find exploits. So what's the way to prevent AI from going kind of nuts?

[02:18:33]
I I think part of it is just having AI widely deployed so that way, like, the AI for 1 system defends itself against the AI that, like, is is potentially doing something problematic in another system. I think it's like AI wars. That's not wars. I think it's just like It's That's not wars. I think it's just like it's, I don't know.

[02:18:52]
It's I think it's a very it's sort of like why there are guns. Right? It's like because, I mean, there's Boy. Like, part of it is hunting. Wars.

[02:19:01]
Part of it is hunting. No. No. No. And and part of it is, like, the people can defend each other.

[02:19:05]
Yeah. Yeah. And it's

[02:19:07]
so And it's a virus software.

[02:19:09]
Yeah. It's like, I don't I don't think you wanna live in a world where, like, only 1 person has all the guns.

[02:19:15]
Yes. You certainly don't wanna live in a world where only the government has the AI.

[02:19:19]
Yeah. Yeah. And especially not a world where only a government has the AI and it's not our government. Yes. So Yes.

[02:19:26]
Which, I mean, I think is is part of the issue is, like, when people talk about trying to lock this stuff down, like, I just am skeptical that that's even possible. I mean, because I kind of think, like, if we try to lock it down, then we're gonna be in a position where the only people who are gonna have access to it are the big companies working on it and the Chinese government that steals it from them.

[02:19:45]
Yes.

[02:19:46]
So I I kinda just think, like, no. What you wanna do is, like, get this to be open source, have it widely available. Yeah. Some, like, adversaries might also have access to it, but the way that you defend against that is by having it built into all these different systems.

[02:19:59]
I think that's a realistic pragmatic perspective because I don't think you can contain it at this point. I think it's far too late, especially when other countries are working on it. It's far too late. It's, it is what it is. It's happening.

[02:20:11]
And, I think the guardrails, as you said, are really important. I have to pee so bad. So let's pee and come back because I wanna talk about a couple other things. Yeah. Sure.

[02:20:19]
Be right back, folks. So 1 of the things that I wanna talk about was, I've been doing this thing, this transition from Apple to Android. Mhmm. And the difficulty of doing it, how locked you are in their ecosystem, partly, is because Apple does a really good job of incorporating everything and making it very easy, your photos, your calendar, your this, your that, your Imessage. But I don't like being attached to 1 company like that.

[02:20:44]
It drives me crazy. And when I'm trying to get off it's it's funny how many people you I mean, they've done an insane job because, like, I think there's some enormous percentage of kids today that only use iPhones. You know. And when you try to switch over to Android, it's it's so much easier to switch from Android to Apple because so many people have Apple. When you switch from Apple to Android, you kinda have to, like, redo your whole system.

[02:21:07]
Mhmm. It's such a pain in the butt, But there's so much of what Apple does that I don't like. And 1 of the big ones is the way they do that Apple store, the way they they charge people 30%. But that seems so insane that they can get away with doing that. And I know

[02:21:25]
I have some opinions about this. I know

[02:21:26]
you do. That's why I brought it up.

[02:21:28]
Yeah. No. I I I mean, look, the iPhone is obviously 1 of the most important inventions probably of all time. You know, Steve Jobs came out with it in 2007. I started Facebook in 2004.

[02:21:45]
So he was working on the iPhone while I was getting started with Facebook. So I I basically you know, 1 of my 1 of the things that's been interesting in my 20 years of running the company is that I I basically like, the the dominant platform out there is smartphones. On the 1 hand, it's been great for us because we are able to build these tools that everyone can have in their pocket. And there's, like, 4,000,000,000 people who use the different apps that we use, and it's like, I'm grateful that that platform exists. But we didn't play any role in in basically building that, those phones, because, I mean, it was kinda getting worked on while I was, you know, still just trying to make the first website that I was making into a thing.

[02:22:29]
And, on the 1 hand, it's been great, because, you know, now pretty much everyone in the world has a phone, and that's a kind of it enables pretty amazing things. But on the other hand, like you're saying, they have used that platform to put in place a lot of rules that I think it feel arbitrary and feel like, you know, they haven't really invented anything great in a while. And it's like Steve Jobs invented the the iPhone, and now they're just kinda sitting on it 20 years later. And, you you know, they actually I think year over year, I'm not even sure they're selling more iPhones at this point. I think, like, the sales might actually be declining.

[02:23:14]
And part of it is that each generation doesn't actually get that much better. So people are just taking longer to upgrade than they would before. So the number of sales, I think, is is generally been flat to declining. So how are they making more money as a company? Well, they do it by basically, like, squeezing people.

[02:23:30]
And, like you're saying, like, having this 30% tax on developers, by getting you to buy more peripherals and things that plug into it. You know, they build stuff like AirPods, which are cool, but they've just thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way. So, I mean, there are a lot of other companies in the world that would be able to build, like, a very good earbud, But it just, Apple has a specific protocol that they've built into the iPhone that allows AirPods to basically connect to it, and and it's just much more seamless, because they've enabled that. But they don't let anyone else use the protocol. If they did, there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there.

[02:24:27]
And, and whenever you push on this, they get super touchy, and they they basically wrap their defense of it in well, if we let other companies plug into our thing, then that would violate people's privacy and security. It's, like, no. Just do a better job designing the protocol. Right? I mean, we have, you know, we basically ask them for the Ray Ban meta glbuttes that we built.

[02:24:50]
Can we basically use the protocol they use for for AirPod and and and some of these other things to just make it so we can as easily connect. So it's it's not like, you know, a pain in the butt for people who wanna use this. And, you know, it's a they they oh, I think 1 of the protocols they've used, that they built, they basically didn't encrypt it. So it's like plain text. And they're like, well, we can't have you plug into it because it would be insecure.

[02:25:18]
It's like, it's insecure because you didn't build any security into it, and then now you're using that as a justification for why only your product can connect in in in an easy way. It's like the the whole thing is kind of wild. And I'm pretty optimistic that just because they've been so off their game in terms of not really releasing many innovative things, eventually I mean, the good news about the tech industry is it's, like, it's just super dynamic, and things are constantly getting invented. And I think companies if you just don't do a good job for, like, 10 years, eventually, you're just gonna get beat by someone. But I don't know.

[02:25:58]
I mean, at some point, I did this, like, back of the envelope calculation of, like, all the random rules that Apple puts out. If, you know, if they didn't apply, like, I think you know, it's like and this is just meta. I think we'd, like, make twice as much profit or something. And and that's just us. I mean, it's like all these small companies that, like, probably can't even exist because of the taxes that they put in place.

[02:26:21]
So, yeah, I I I think it's a it's a big issue. I I wish that they would just kinda get back to building good things and not having their ability to compete be connected to just, like, advantaging their stuff. Because I'm pretty sure what they're gonna do is, like, they're gonna take something like this Ray Ban meta, you know, category that we've kind of created with Ray Ban and the the company that built that. They're, like, the the really great AI glbuttes. And I'm pretty sure Apple's just gonna, like, try to build a version of that, but then just, like, advantage how it connects to the phone and

[02:27:00]
Well, they did that with their AR goggle thing, but it's not very successful.

[02:27:05]
No. That 1, they didn't actually connect into the rest of their ecosystem. But, I mean, look. I mean, they shipped something for $35100 that I think is worse than the thing that we shipped for $300 or $400. So, I mean, that clearly was not gonna work very well.

[02:27:20]
Now, I mean, look. I mean, they're a good technology company. I think their their, their second and third version will probably be better than their first version. But, yeah, no. I think, the the the Vision Pro is, I think, 1 of the bigger swings at doing a new thing that they tried in a while.

[02:27:41]
And, you know, I I I don't I don't wanna give them too hard of a time on it, because we do a lot of things where the first version isn't that good. You wanna kinda judge the 3rd version of it. But, I mean, the v 1, it definitely did not hit it out of the park.

[02:27:52]
I heard it's really good for watching movies.

[02:27:55]
Well, it's it's the the whole thing is it's got a super sharp screen.

[02:27:58]
Mhmm.

[02:27:59]
So if you're yeah. So if you wanna basically have a, an experience where you're not moving around much in VR, you just wanna have the sharpest screen, then for that 1 use case, I think the Vision Pro is better than Quest, which is our our mixed reality headset. But in order to get to that, they had to make all these other trade offs. Right? In order to have a super high resolution screen, they had to put in all this more compute in order to power the high res screen.

[02:28:30]
And then all that compute needed a bigger battery, so now the thing is really heavy. So now it's uncomfortable to wear. And, and then, like, because of the screen that they chose, as you move your head, which you would if you're actually interacting, if you're playing games, like, the the the kind of image blurs a bit, and that's kind of annoying. So you wouldn't so it's actually worse for things where you're moving around in. But no.

[02:28:51]
For the if you're gonna sit, if you're, like, on a flight and you wanna have a $35100 device that you use to to to watch videos, VisionPRO is better for that use case.

[02:29:04]
They're really good at keeping you in their walled garden. That's what they're really good at.

[02:29:08]
Yeah. I mean, the the whole thing that they've done with Imessage, where they basically they do this whole blue bubble, green bubble thing, and it basically I mean, they're like, for kids, it's just sort of, like, they embarrbutt you. Right? They're like, if you don't have a blue bubble, you're not cool, and you're like the out crowd. And then they always wrap it in, like, security.

[02:29:31]
It's like, oh, well, we we do this blue bubble because of security. Meanwhile, Google and others have this whole protocol to be able to do encrypted text messages that, finally, I think Apple was forced to implement it

[02:29:42]
by CS.

[02:29:43]
Yeah. Yeah. I think, like, I think it was the Chinese government that basically ended up forcing them to do it or some other government.

[02:29:48]
But it's still not encrypted. Even when you're sending RCS text messages, I don't think it's encrypted.

[02:29:53]
Oh, I thought it was, but maybe I'm

[02:29:54]
I think it's only encrypted Google to Google Phones. I don't think it's encrypted iPhone to Google Phones or Google Phones to iPhones. Because I I think that was actually, was it the FBI? Someone released that, say telling people that if they're talking about sensitive things, they should use encrypted apps, like WhatsApp. See if we can find that.

[02:30:15]
It was something where they were saying that contrary to popular belief that RCS texting to iPhone

[02:30:24]
GSMA aims to implement end to end encryption for RCS messaging. We see it. I meant it's not a good answer. I'm trying

[02:30:30]
to find a good answer.

[02:30:31]
I don't have anything to show you yet. I was trying to read

[02:30:33]
Yeah. So so Google RCS to our like But

[02:30:36]
I don't know if this

[02:30:37]
Android phone to Android phone is encrypted with RCS. I think the issue comes with it going from so, like, say, Google, Google this. Google RCS texting to iPhones, is it encrypted? RCS texting to Imessage, is it encrypted? I'm pretty sure it's not.

[02:31:00]
I might be wrong. I don't think I am. I'm pretty sure I read that. And the problem was they won't let any other phone use the Imessage protocol, and they had a company that was doing it called beeper. And they were doing it through some sort of workaround.

[02:31:16]
It's

[02:31:16]
not encrypted. Yeah.

[02:31:17]
It's not encrypted. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. So it's not.

[02:31:22]
So you're you are getting the ability to send high resolution images, which is great because, you know, like my friend Brian, who use an Android, he'd send me a video and it'd be this tiny little Yeah. Broken down box because, you know, you had to break it down to the lowest resolution.

[02:31:37]
Yeah. No. I mean, group chats when you have a bunch of people in Imessage and then 1 person is an Android are terrible. I mean, that's People get mad at you.

[02:31:45]
People get

[02:31:45]
mad at you? Because Well, I use WhatsApp. So I use WhatsApp. You only use that. I I'll I only communicate with a few people over SMS, but it's, but, basically, I I mean, I mean, I build, you know, a lot of leading messaging services, so I've gotta use ours.

[02:32:03]
I I most people, I'm either WhatsApp or Instagram direct or Messenger. But yeah. So I I think it's it's maybe maybe people are less less, likely to get mad at me for asking them to use WhatsApp because,

[02:32:20]
because you

[02:32:20]
only make WhatsApp. Yeah.

[02:32:21]
So When, Tucker Carlson was about to interview Vladimir Putin, 1 of the things that was really disturbing was they contacted him and said they read his signal messages, and they knew that he was gonna interview Vladimir Putin. And he was like, what the freak?

[02:32:34]
Who did?

[02:32:35]
The the government.

[02:32:36]
The US?

[02:32:37]
Yes. US government. I forget what it was. Was it the CIA or was it the FBI? Wow.

[02:32:41]
I forget who it was. But and he was, like, I didn't even know you could do that.

[02:32:45]
Like Well, there are multiple vulnerabilities and all this stuff. It's, like, it's unclear if I doubt that what they did was they broke Signal, because that encryption, I think, is pretty good as is WhatsApp. I mean, it's basically Signal and WhatsApp use the same encryption. It's it's an open source and, like, it's a NSA. NSA.

[02:33:03]
Okay. But

[02:33:04]
someone could break into your phone and see everything that's on your phone. The the thing that encryption does that's really good is, it makes it so that the company that's running the service doesn't see it. So if you're using WhatsApp, basically, when I text you on WhatsApp, there's no point at which the meta servers see the contents of that message. Unless, like, you know, we took a photo of it or shared that back to Meta in some other way. That basically, it cuts out the company completely from it, which is, I think, really important for a bunch of reasons.

[02:33:41]
1 is people might not trust the company, but also just security issues. Right? Like, let's say someone hacks into Meta, which, you know, we try really hard to make it so they can't, and we haven't had many issues with that over the 20 years of running the company. But in theory, if someone did, then they'd be able to access everyone's messages if it weren't encrypted. But because it's encrypted, there's just nothing there.

[02:34:05]
Right? It's like, I mean, they can't hack into Meta and then get access to your messages. So now someone like the NSA or CIA would have to kind of hack into your phone, which, you know, there there are probably ways to do that. Pegasus. I mean, there are probably a bunch of ways.

[02:34:21]
Yeah. Yeah.

[02:34:22]
There's probably ways we don't know of.

[02:34:23]
Yeah. And and then, of course, there's always the ultimate kind of physical part of it, which is if you have access to the computer, you can usually just break in. Right? So that's why, you know, if the FBI, you know, arrests you and takes your phone, they're probably gonna be able to get in and see what's there.

[02:34:41]
Mhmm. So WhatsApp is encrypted, but if someone has something like Pegasus, what they do is have access to your phone. So it doesn't matter if anything's encrypted. They could just see it in plain sight.

[02:34:55]
Yeah. And, I mean, this is 1 of the reasons why we put disappearing messages in too. Because that way oh, yeah. If someone has compromised your phone and they can see everything that's going on there, then, obviously, they can see stuff as it comes in. But I kind of, in general, just, you know, think we should keep around as little of that stuff as possible.

[02:35:12]
So there are some threads where, you know, it's like there's photos that get shared. You want the photos. But I think for a lot of threads, a lot of people just, you know, you know, wouldn't be I don't think most people would miss it if most of the contents of their threads just disappeared after 7 days. Right. You know, what what I find is I don't I don't use it that much because we have this, like, corporate policy at meta that we would need to retain all our our documents and messages and stuff.

[02:35:41]
But, but before we had that, I I used it as we were developing this. And every once in a while, I would miss something and say, wow, I kinda wish I could go back and see that, but it was very rare. And I think most communication, it's kinda like, you just have the communication, and then you're done. So having it be encrypted and disappearing, I think, is a pretty good kind of standard of security and privacy.

[02:36:06]
And you can set that disappearing time on WhatsApp. Right? You can make it 1 day if you want.

[02:36:11]
Yeah. You can do 1 day. You can do 7 days. And you can also set it across all your threads. You can have a default timer.

[02:36:18]
So that way, as new threads get created, your default timer just becomes the default for all those threads. So I know that's a it's a really good feature. And I basically think WhatsApp and Signal are probably the 2 most secure that are out there, on that. And of those 2, I think WhatsApp is just used by a lot more people. So I think it's it's generally you know, I I mean, I I would say this because it's it's it's our product, but I do think it's it's the better product.

[02:36:43]
But but I think WhatsApp and Signal are basically, you know, the 2 most secure ones.

[02:36:48]
What was your take on that guy getting arrested as the CEO of Telegram?

[02:36:54]
Oh, man. That's kinda

[02:36:56]
a crazy 1. Right?

[02:36:57]
Yeah. I mean, it's always a little difficult to weigh in on these situations without knowing all the specifics. But 1 of the government tactics that I've seen that I think is pretty is not great is an increasing number of governments when they, like, have an issue with something that a company is doing, basically just, like, threaten to throw the executives of that company in prison. And it's like I think that that's just a really weird precedent to set. Right?

[02:37:32]
It's like it it's if if the you have all the so it's like, we're operating in all these different countries, and then, like, you have all these governments that are basically like, if you I don't know. We're gonna, like, put out an Interpol notice to, like, get you arrested because you're not doing the thing that we want. It's like, I don't know. I don't I think that's, like, not great. I think you want the obviously, you don't want people to just be, like, flagrantly violating the laws, but, like, there are laws in different countries that we disagree with.

[02:38:04]
Right? So for example, there was a point at which I think I was someone was trying to get me sentenced to death in Pakistan, because they thought that oh, because someone on Facebook had a picture of where they had the drawing of the prophet Mohammed, and someone said that that's blasphemy in our culture. And they brought a they basically, like, sued me, and they opened this criminal proceeding. And I I don't know exactly where it went, because I'm just not planning on going to Pakistan, so I was not that worried about it. But but, like, but but it was a little bit disconcerting.

[02:38:40]
It was, like, alright. Fine. Like, these guys are, like, trying to, like like Kill you. Okay. It's not great.

[02:38:45]
Right? You know, it's not like not yeah. I mean, it's like I feel like I yeah. It's like flying over that region. You don't want your plane to, like, go down above Pakistan if that thing goes through, but but that 1 was sort of avoidable.

[02:38:57]
But the the point is, like, there are all these places around the world that just have different values, right, that go against, like, our free expression values and want us to crack down and and ban way more stuff than I think, you know, a lot of people that we would believe is, like, the right thing to do. And to have those governments be able to exert the power of saying, okay. We're gonna, like, throw you in prison is that's a lot of force. I mean, so I I I think it's it's generally yeah. I think that this is 1 of the things that that the US government is probably gonna need to help defend the American tech companies for abroad.

[02:39:33]
But I I don't I I can't weigh in that much on on the Duraev specific thing because I don't know what was going on there.

[02:39:41]
You know, when you're dealing with, the government trying to interfere with Facebook, how much of a fear was there that they were gonna get away with it and that this was going to be the future of communication online? That it was going to that they were gonna be successful with all this, that they would push these things through somehow or another, especially if a even less tolerant administration got into power? They would change laws, and they would do things to make it possible. Like, how how how much did that concern you?

[02:40:13]
Well, we basically just reached a point where we pushed back on all the stuff. Right? So they were pushing us to censor stuff. We were unwilling to do it. We developed a very adversarial and bad relationship with our own government, which I think is just not healthy, because I think, you know, it's, I mean, in in in theory, I think, you know, it would be good if the, like, American industry had a positive relationship with the American government.

[02:40:43]
But then when that happened is then the the, kind of, US government was going after us in all these ways. But fortunately, in the US, you know, we have good rule of law. So our view is at the end of the day, okay, these invest these agencies can open up investigations, and we'll just defend ourselves. Right? We'll go to court, and we'll win all the cases because we're you know, we follow the rules.

[02:41:05]
And, so I think it ends up being a big kind of political issue where it's, like, it it would just be you could get a lot more done if the government were helping American companies rather than kind of slowing you down at every step along the way. It makes you a little afraid that if you ever actually mess something up, that they're really gonna bring the hammer down on you if you don't have a constructive relationship. But, but I don't know. It's mostly I mean, going back to the AI conversation, it's, like, I just think, like, we should all want the American companies to win at this. Right?

[02:41:46]
It's like this is like a huge geopolitical competition, and, like, China's running at it super hard, and, like, we should want the American companies and the American standard to win. And, like, if there's gonna be an open source model that everyone uses, like, we should want it to be an American model. Right? It's, like, the there's this great Chinese model that just came out. This company DeepSeek, they're doing really good work.

[02:42:08]
It's a very advanced model. And if you ask it for any negative opinions about Xi Jinping, it will not give you anything. If you ask it if Tiananmen Square happened, it will deny it. Right? So I think that there are, like, all these things where we we we should we should want the American model to win.

[02:42:25]
But, like, at every step along the way, if the government is sort of making that harder rather than easier, then that's I don't know. I mean, there's there's an extent to which, okay, the American tech industry is leading, so maybe the government can, like, get in the way a little bit, and maybe the the American industry will still lead. But I don't know. It's I think it's getting really competitive. And I I I think, like, it's easy for the government to take for granted that the US will lead on all these things when I I think it's a very close competition, and we need the help, not you know, we need them to not kinda, like, you know, be be a be a force that's helping us to to do these things.

[02:43:02]
I completely agree. But I think that people with their own self interest, when they're in power and they realize that these new technologies like Instagram and Facebook, that they are interfering with their ability to administer propaganda or that their their ability to control the narrative. That that's where they get shortsighted. And that's when they act in their own personal interest and not in the interest of not neither national security or the future of the United States in terms of our ability to stay technologically ahead.

[02:43:34]
Yeah. And some of this is just you know, if you go back to the COVID example, I think in that case, they were doing something their goal of trying to get everyone to get vaccinated was actually, I think, a good goal. Right? It's like I I It

[02:43:51]
was a good goal if it worked. Yeah. If it was real. Like, if it was a sterilizing vaccine, if it really did prevent people from getting COVID, if it really did prevent people from infecting others or transmitting it, but it didn't.

[02:44:03]
Well So

[02:44:04]
it wasn't a good deal because it wasn't based on real data.

[02:44:07]
Yeah. But but also even but even if it were. Right? It's like if if I mean, I I I think that still on balance, knowing everything that we we know now, still think it's good for more people to get the vaccine, but the government still needs to play by the rules in terms of, you know, not like, can't just suppress true things in order to make your case. So I I I that's that's kinda my my my view on on it is is I'm not sure in that case how much of it was like a personal political gain that they were going for.

[02:44:36]
I think that they had a a kind of goal that they thought was in the interests of a country, and the way they went about it, I think, violated the law.

[02:44:44]
Well, there's a bunch of problems with that. Right? There's the emergency use authorization that they needed in order to get this pushed through, and you can't have that without valid with with valid therapeutics being available. And so they suppressed valid therapeutics. So they're suppressing real information that would lead to people being healthy and successful in defeating this disease.

[02:45:06]
And they did that so that they could have this 1 solution, and this was Fauci's game plan. I mean, this is the movie American Buyer's Club or Dallas Buyers Club, rather. That's Fauci in that movie. That was with the AIDS crisis. This is exact same game plan that was played out with the COVID vaccine.

[02:45:21]
They pushed 1 solution, this only 1, suppressed all therapeutics through propaganda, through suppressing monoclonal antibodies, like, all of it. And that was done, in my opinion, for profit. And they did that because it was extremely profitable. The amount of money that was made Yeah. Was extraordinary during that time.

[02:45:43]
Yeah. And but look. I mean, I feel like a bunch of the conversation is focused on tension with the American government. I I guess just the point that I'd underscore is that it's important to have this working in the American government because it is like, the US constitution and, like, our culture here is really good compared to a lot of other places. Right?

[02:46:06]
So whatever issues we think might exist here, you go to other places, and it's, like, really extreme. Yeah. And you don't even and and there, it's like, you don't even necessarily have the rule of law. Right. Right?

[02:46:17]
And, so I just think that, like, the way that this stuff works well is yeah. I think if if if there was a clearer strategy and the the US government understood, believe that it's good to kinda help advance this industry because it's strategically important for the country, then I think it would it would be good to basically push back on stuff that's happening in other countries that's actually a lot more extreme than the stuff that's happening in the US.

[02:46:47]
Yeah. I agree as well. Listen, is there anything else you wanna talk about before we wrap this up? I think we're good? I don't know.

[02:46:54]
I mean,

[02:46:55]
how long we've been going for? 3 hours. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, I I feel like we touched on we touched on AI.

[02:47:01]
We touched on all the augmented and and virtual reality stuff. And I think that that stuff is just gonna be wild.

[02:47:08]
It's wild. The the your AR, technology that you showed me today is very impressive. It's crazy. Lex and I were playing Pong, like, apart from a table from each other. I was playing some crazy game where my fingers got tired because you shoot like this.

[02:47:24]
Because you're using v 1 of the neural interface. Yes. Yeah. I know. It's like it's like in the future, it'll just be this.

[02:47:28]
It was like

[02:47:30]
It was really fun, though. It's really cool. And it's it's you see where this is all going, you know. It's really, really fascinating stuff, and I'm very excited about it.

[02:47:38]
Did you get a chance to to use the Ray Bans and the AI in them?

[02:47:40]
Yes. We did that too. And we did translate to where 1 of your, 1 of your co coworkers were speaking to me in Spanish, and it was translating it to me in my ear in real time in English, which is really interesting. Nice. Amazing.

[02:47:53]
Yeah. It's really cool. And then you could also do it on the phone. So you could show it to the person on the phone, so you don't have to say the words. Like, it's really fascinating stuff.

[02:48:01]
Yeah. So, I mean, we're just sort of coming at it from both sides. Right? It's like the the Ray Bans are like, okay. Given a good looking pair of glbuttes, what's all the technology you can put into that today and still have it be, you know, just a few $100?

[02:48:14]
And then the Orion thing is, like, alright. We're building the kind of future thing that we want, and we're doing our best to miniaturize it. It's basically, like

[02:48:22]
Still pretty small. Yeah. I mean, it's just thicker glbuttes.

[02:48:25]
Yeah. And I I think we want it to be a little smaller. We need it to be a lot cheaper. Right? Each pair right now costs more than $10,000 to make, and that's you're not gonna have a successful consumer product at that.

[02:48:34]
So we have to miniaturize it more. But, I mean, the amount of stuff that we put in there from it's, like, effectively, like, what would have been considered a supercomputer, like, 10 or 20 years ago, plus, you know, lasers in the arms and the, like, nano etchings on the on the lens to be able to to see it and the microphone and the speaker and the Wi Fi to be able to connect with the other it's just like like the wild amount of technology to kinda miniaturize into something. That one's really fun. We've been working on that for 10 years. But yeah.

[02:49:04]
No. I think I think between that, the glbuttes, all the AI stuff, yeah, All the social media stuff. Yeah. No. I I mean

[02:49:14]
I think we covered it. And, I'm very excited about this new stance that you guys are taking. I think the community notes thing is a brilliant idea that, you know, x has implemented. And I think I'm I'm I am really glad that you guys are implementing it too. I think it's the way.

[02:49:27]
And the way, generally, I think we both agree is that people have to have the ability to communicate. They have to have the ability to express themselves, and that's how we find out what's real and what's not.

[02:49:37]
Yeah. I I think the more voice is the is the answer on this.

[02:49:41]
Yes. Yes, sir.

[02:49:42]
And I think after a after sort of a long journey, I'm glad to be able to take it back to the roots, and I feel like we're more fortified now in the position.

[02:49:52]
Well, I think 1 of the lessons that people have learned over the last few years with, suppression of information is that that's not good, and there's a giant percentage of the population that feels that way. And even people that are progressive and liberals are on the they were on the side of the people that were pushing the the suppression of information. Still don't think it's right. I think most people generally believe in the First Amendment in this country, and they we realize how valuable it is to have the freedom of expression.

[02:50:17]
Yeah. Anyway, thanks for having me.

[02:50:20]
Thank you, Mark. Appreciate it. Bye, everybody.

Check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience.

[00:00:06]
Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day. All right, we're rolling.

[00:00:14]
Good to see you.

[00:00:15]
Here we go. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about, I wanted to play this, but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get copyright strike. And we don't want. Get the episode. We don't want anybody to have any sort of a way to get it down.

[00:00:30]
Sure.

[00:00:30]
But it was the episode of you when you're on the View, and I think it was 2015 or 2006. Like when you were running for president.

[00:00:39]
Right.

[00:00:40]
And you sat. You got introduced as our friend Donald Trump.

[00:00:45]
That's right.

[00:00:45]
Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss. Joy Behar gives you a big hug. Barbara Walters gives you a big hug. They all loved you. They were all talking about how you might be conservative in your financial positions, but you're very liberal socially. They were talking about you in such a favorable light. The audience was cheering. And then you actually started winning in the polls, and then the machine started working towards you. But there's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically. When you see those same people in the past, very favorable to you. Like Oprah, when you were on Oprah show, very. She was encouraging you.

[00:01:38]
Last week, I did one of her last shows, I think maybe Thursday or Friday. There was a big deal being on Oprah's show, the last one. And I was like, one of the last shows in that last. That final week. And I said, boy, we've come a long way since that.

[00:01:53]
What was it like?

[00:01:55]
Well, the concept, it was really like two different lives. You know, I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong. We had 12 seasons, and we had actually 14 seasons, 12 years over. They had a couple of.

[00:02:11]
Well, they canceled the Apprentice when you were running for president, correct?

[00:02:14]
No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it. I was involved in that. And I want. I had enough of it. And we did great. It was doing great. But they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me. They said, we're going to give you a contract. They wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett is a great guy, and they wanted to extend the contract. Mark said, you're crazy. Don't run. Don't run. Nobody gives up primetime. They said, you know, it's one of those little things, which is probably true.

[00:02:40]
Nobody gives up primetime, though, for being.

[00:02:42]
President, for running well, for running against 20 some odd people, you know, turned out to be 18, 18 professional people, you know, mostly politicians. They said, who would do this? I mean, it's a long shot, actually. The heads of NBC came over the Paul Telegny. All the. All the top people came over to see me try and talk me out of it because they wanted to have me extend. The Apprentice was doing well. So it was 14 seasons. It was 12 years. We had 12 seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens. It was just a hot show. And I said, you know, I want to do this. What happened is previously, like three years, four years before that, they did a poll, they had Mitt Romney, and somehow they put me in a poll. And I blew everybody away. I blew him away, which isn't that hard, frankly, but I blew everybody away. And I said, that's interesting because I never really gave it that much real thought. I thought about it, but never real thought. But I saw these polls were very good, and so I was thinking about doing it then.

[00:03:40]
But I had a contract with the Apprentice. Plus I was building two big buildings at the time and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly. And it's one of those things. The kids were just sort of getting involved. They're very capable kids, but they were getting involved early on. So I did that. I got them done. I had some very good successes. And I came on and then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster. And I ran and I won against Hillary and it was quite an experience, but it was a different life. Because you're right, the View. I was on the View many, many times, and they loved me just the.

[00:04:16]
Way people would talk. I mean, even if people had criticisms about you, people that didn't like you, there was always feuds and stuff like that. But the reality was the thing turned on you when they found out that you were going to be president. It was very coordinated. And some people are catching on to that now. There's a lot of people that were longtime Democrats, like Elon and Bill Ackman and all these different, very intelligent people.

[00:04:38]
And they support me now. Bill Ackman supports me. He's very supportive, too.

[00:04:42]
This is what I wanted to ask you. What was it like when you actually got in? Because nobody really can prepare you for that when you're running for president. You don't really know what it's going to be like when you actually get into office, what was the. What did you think it was going to be like?

[00:04:56]
So you got in office or when I decided to run?

[00:04:58]
No, when you got in.

[00:04:59]
When I was in. So when I was in and won and was in the White House, essentially. Well, first of all, it was very surreal.

[00:05:07]
Oh, that was.

[00:05:08]
It's very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. That should have been surreal. When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit. They were saying, you were hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear. You would know that better than anyone when they get the ear torn up. Ears bleed a lot anyway, so. And I was thinking the other day, when that happened, I really knew where I was. I knew exactly what happened. I said I wasn't hit anywhere else with the presidency. It was a very surreal experience.

[00:05:41]
Okay, what's day one? Life. You win, you get inaugurated. Holy shoot. I'm the President.

[00:05:47]
Yeah, that's what happened. So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I had just built a building on Pennsylvania. You know, the hotel, the old post office. It was. We called it Trump National Hotel, and we sold it to the Waldorf Astoria. And it was a wonderful thing. But I'm driving down, I'm pbutting the hotel. You've never seen so many motorcycles, Police, military, you know, it was a major thing. I got off, really, the first time I used Air Force One landed, and we're coming down, and they were. It was very. I mean, it was incredible. And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction. You know, normally you're used to going one way, and all of a sudden you're going the other way. The street was loaded up, and I wanted to go out and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart. You know, the kid's a little bit dangerous. Right? I mean, when you watch, like, Kennedy and some others. Right. But I really felt. I don't know, the love was so crazy. And so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk.

[00:06:51]
I thought it was very important to do. And Melania got out with her beautiful dress on. That became sort of a staple. It was. People loved it and barren and were walking down the street. But where it really got amazing. We get to the White House, and now it's a little bit. A little bit before dark. Beautiful. And we went up to the President's quarters. They call them the presidential quarters. And I'm standing in this beautiful hallway. You know, it's funny. Nobody ever talks about the White House as being beautiful inside. You know, you think it's going to be. Everything's going to be all metal doors and stuff. It's not. It's so beautiful. I made my money largely on luxury. The hallway is like 25ft wide. The ceiling heights are every. It's so beautiful. But I was standing there and I said to the guys, I want to see the Lincoln Bedroom. I had never seen the Lincoln Bedroom. I'd heard about the Lincoln Bedroom, and I was standing with my wife. I said, do you believe it? This is the Lincoln Bedroom. I mean, it was like. It was amazing because it's. Look, if you love the country.

[00:08:04]
But here you are, the Lincoln Bedroom. And the bed, you know, he was very tall. He was 6 foot 6. Which then would be like Barron. It would be like Baron Trump. He's 6, 9, but 6 foot 6. He was very tall then. On top of that, he wore.

[00:08:19]
There it is.

[00:08:20]
He wore that. Yeah, there it is. It's a long bed, elongated bed. And because very, you know, people were shorter than. You see, some of the chairs are very, very low to the ground, actually. But he had the long bed. And they had. You had the Gettysburg Address right on that, right under that. You can't see it here, but right there, the original version of the Gettysburg Address. And this is the original. And I'm looking, and I just looked around, I said, do you believe this? Because I was never a polit. First of all. Even if you were a politician. But I was never a politician. It just. I sort of just started. Right, right. And all of a sudden, I'm standing in the White House, and it was very, very surreal. That room was so beautiful to me. Much more beautiful than it actually is, you know, to me, when I looked at the bed, and the bed you could see was a little bit longer. Had to be a little bit longer. He lost his son. And they suffered. The two of them suffered from melancholia. They didn't call it depression. They called it melancholia, and they suffered from it.

[00:09:22]
He was a very depressed guy, and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him. And on top of that, they lost their son, whose name was Ted. Ted. And it was just seeing it in the little picture, the little tiny picture. I mean, you can't see the details there. Little tiny everything. The way it was a little tiny picture of Tad, who he lost. And it was devastating. And he was, you know, he was. Look he was in a war. He was. He was. And he was having a hard time because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row. And he was getting like a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about the fight stuff. But, like, I went to a UFC fight, and it was a champion who was 14 and 1 about a year ago, you would know the names, 14 and 1. And the only guy he lost to was this one guy. But the guy that he was fighting was like, almost just an average fighter. Lost numerous times, but he beat this one guy. So I said, okay, I really don't.

[00:10:28]
Know who you're talking about.

[00:10:30]
I will figure it out. Okay, but about a year ago. But the point is that he lost. He wasn't nearly the fighter, but the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten. He's the only guy that beat them, the champ, like, five years before. And I said, I'll take the guy that won the other fight. And that's what happened. He beat him a second time.

[00:10:49]
Sometimes psychological advances.

[00:10:51]
Yeah. What is this crazy thing? Lincoln had a. I don't know. I've never read this. I heard it from people in the White House who really understand what was going on with the whole life of the White House. But Lincoln had the yips about, in a way, as the golfers would say, he had a phobia about Robert E. Lee. He said, I can't beat Robert E. Because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row. He was just beating the hell out of him. You know, they tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the north, but he said, no, I have to be with my state. You know, the state was his whole thing. And he went to the south and he was. I've had generals tell me we have some great generals. The real generals, not the ones you see on television, the ones that beat isis. With me, we defeated ISIS in record time. It was supposed to take years, and we did it in a matter of weeks. These are great generals. These are tough guys. These are not woke guys. But their favorite general, in terms of genius was Robert E.

[00:11:49]
Lee in terms of strategy. You mean strategy strategically. He took a war that should have been over in a few days. And it was, you know, years of hell, a vicious war. And so here I am standing there, and again, I had never really done this before. You know, I ran. I ran a number of months before I won. I probably. I guess if you figured max it out, it would be a year, something like that. So I had never run for office, and I did well. I mean, I went into debates. We had 18 people, including me, and then slowly but surely, they started to disappear. We had debates, good debates.

[00:12:32]
Everyone's aware of all this stuff. But what I want to get to is, like, what was the experience once you got inside? What did you think it was going to be like in terms of, like, your ability to govern?

[00:12:41]
Yeah.

[00:12:41]
Like, this is your first experience governing anything. You never been a governor, you've never been a mayor.

[00:12:46]
Private. Private stuff.

[00:12:48]
Business.

[00:12:48]
Yeah.

[00:12:48]
But now, all of a sudden, you're inside the White House.

[00:12:50]
The biggest thing was just that first moment of being in this hallowed. It was really a hallowed place to me. It was surreal. It was beyond. To me, that was the experience. It was a surreal experience. And then with time, that wears off. With time, it becomes, you know, your place where you stay. And I was doing a lot of. I was. I had two things today really focused on governing the country and survival. Because from the moment I won, before I got to office, all of a sudden, I mean, they came down. I mean, nobody has ever been treated that way. And you see that. I mean, you see, we're in the Washington Post very early on, they said, well, now the impeachment stuff starts. And it did. I mean, it literally started from the beginning. So I had survival and run the nation. I had a combination. Most people don't have the survival they get in.

[00:13:45]
What did you expect, though, in terms of, like, once you got inside, you had to appoint all these people. Like, how many appointments did you have to make?

[00:13:53]
Actually, 10,000 appointments. Now, they're different. You know, you have big ones, and then they appoint.

[00:13:59]
Right.

[00:13:59]
100 people and 200 people, but the president really is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments. So you'll appoint a secretary of state, and he will. He or she will appoint a lot of people. So it's a lot. But in terms of major ones, you probably have like 100. But they're big ones. Treasury, state, military.

[00:14:21]
And how did you know who to appoint?

[00:14:23]
Well, I didn't. I had no experience. You have to understand.

[00:14:27]
So are you.

[00:14:27]
17 times in Washington, and I never stayed over, according to the press, which I think is probably right over the years. I was only there 17 times. I never stayed over. So now I'm sitting there, I'm saying, this place is gorgeous. But, you know, I don't know anybody. It's like you. You know, you go to certain areas and other areas, they may be great. Washington was great. Washington's not so great. Right now they're going to. We got to fix it. We got to make it better. A very dangerous place, very badly maintained place. We're going to make it great. We're going to make it better. We're going to bring it back. But I wasn't a Washington guy. I was a New York guy. I was a New York builder and I built buildings in New York and I knew that whole world, but I didn't know the Washington world too. And all of a sudden you're supposed to be appointing top people.

[00:15:13]
So what did you think it was going to be like versus like, did you have any ideas of what it was going to be like and what was different?

[00:15:19]
Well, I was always involved in politics, but usually from the standpoint of a donor. I was a donor, you know, I was a big donor. I gave money to politicians I enjoyed.

[00:15:28]
Mostly Democrats, right?

[00:15:30]
Both. Really, Pretty much both. I actually. Pictures of Ronald Reagan and me when I was very young.

[00:15:35]
You were a Democrat until like what year?

[00:15:37]
I was a Democrat. I could get you the exact. But the early 90s, the early 90s. I switched over eventually. Actually, they had a Reform Party. I was thinking about doing that for a little while, but then fortunately I didn't because it's very hard. You know, it's a two party system and anytime you hear third party, I know you like RFK junior And so do I. He's a fantastic guy. I do.

[00:16:01]
But I thought that being an independent was nonsense.

[00:16:03]
It doesn't work. It doesn't work because even if you do great, you're not going to get Congress. In other words, you need now to say, okay, now I'll get half of Congress, that's never going to vote for you. So even if you got there, which is very hard, and I know how you feel about Bobby and I feel the same way and he's now with us, but it doesn't. It's pure and simple. It's a two party system, right. And somebody, I won't mention his name, but somebody spent $250 million trying to get the nomination as a Reform Party candidate or whatever. And they got just nowhere. You get eaten. You just get eaten. The system eats you alive. So it was really somebody that not only was new to Washington, but was new to politics. So in the office of the presidency over the years, all those presidents you've had, 92% were politicians and 8% were generals. General Eisenhower, General Washington. Right. General George Washington. He had generals. So it's 8% generals, no admirals, 8% generals and 92% politicians. You know, they're politicians and they go on. So they never had a business guy or they never had a guy that wasn't elected to an office.

[00:17:20]
They were all like, Ronald Reagan was really. He was a movie actor, but he became the governor of California for, I think, two terms, and then he ran. So you'd never had a thing like this. But I, you know, in terms of me and some. Sometimes I'd use it as an excuse, and I don't like having excuses, actually, but I'd use it as an excuse. I had to rely on people that I respected or liked, but that I didn't know that well, because I didn't know them that well. Some of those people I campaigned against because, you know, when you have 18 people, we had mostly politicians running in the election, you know, running in the primaries, and they got knocked out one by one. But I got to like some of them. Some of them I didn't like at all. I don't like them now. And I'd rely on them and I'd rely on other people. So all of a sudden, people would come in, I'd like to recommend so and so to be Secretary of State, and I'd have three, four people recommend. One thing I can tell you, everybody wants the position, of course.

[00:18:17]
No, no. But sometimes they'll hear. A lot of people don't want to work with Trump because Trump is tough to work with, etc. Let me tell you, everybody wants to be any one of these positions. They die for it.

[00:18:28]
Of course.

[00:18:28]
Now they don't want to be known. I mean, there's a particular guy in New York, primarily very big. Very big, very successful, very strong, very political, although he's not a politician. He'd give anything to be Secretary of State, but if they ask him, no, I don't think I would do it. But in the meantime, begging for it. Okay, begging.

[00:18:52]
I believe you.

[00:18:53]
Everybody, look, everybody wants it.

[00:18:54]
But what I want to get.

[00:18:56]
And by the way, no matter what you do, but it's very dangerous to pick somebody outside of a politician, because a politician's been basically vetted for years, right? You pick a business guy, and they've never been vetted at all. And they're, you know, the head of a big company or something, but they've never been vetted. You know nothing about his personal life, you know nothing about where he's been when you put him in. It's a little bit dangerous because all of a sudden they get checked up and you hear things that you say, wow, this is not going to work out too well. So it's very dangerous. Picking, picking people that are outside of politics is somewhat dangerous.

[00:19:30]
So you're kind of stuck in a position where you have to pick established people. And then the problem with established people is established people are already indoctrinated into the system and they're stiffs.

[00:19:39]
In many cases, they're survivors. I find that, you know, what do.

[00:19:44]
You mean by stiffs when you say stiff?

[00:19:45]
Stiff. They don't have nothing. They have nothing or they're smart and survivor. One little thing. So there was a congressman years before I ran and I was very close to him and I needed a license on something and he was very important in getting the license. But it was a little bit controversial, the license, this particular thing that was being licensed. But I was close to this guy and helped him and everything else. And I went to him, I said, I'd like to have you help. And he said, let me take a look at it. I said, oh, that's not too good, but I really hope you're going to help anyway. He tapped me along for a long period of time and ultimately didn't do it. And I said, you are a stiff. You could have done this thing's so easy, et cetera. But it was controversial. He was in Congress for many years, like 28 years. And you know, there's a reason when somebody's there for 28 years, you gotta be sort of smart, right? You know, you have a survivor. And I realized he was a survivor.

[00:20:41]
And so they never do anything controversial. They never take any chances or speak their opinion. It's outside of the. Yeah, yeah.

[00:20:48]
And yet I don't disrespect him for it. So I actually respected the guy more in a certain way.

[00:20:53]
I said, because he did survive, you.

[00:20:54]
Know what, he's been there like for 28 years and he made it through. A lot of people don't make it through.

[00:21:00]
It's a good way for non exceptional people to survive it.

[00:21:03]
Well, it is. Yeah, it certainly is.

[00:21:05]
So you're, you're in there, you have 10,000 appointments you have to make, like, so you're getting advice from people. And at one point, did you have a moment in time where you realize, like these are bad choices, like some of these people I shouldn't have had in there?

[00:21:19]
Oh, yeah, I think so. The one question that you'll ask me that I think you'll ask me, that people seem to ask and I always come up with the same answer. The one Mistake, Because I had a lot of success. Great economy, great everything. Everything was great. The military rebuilt it. Biggest tax cuts in history, all this stuff. We had a great presidency, three Supreme Court justices. Most people get none. You know, you pick them young. This way, they're there for 50 years. Right. Even if a president is there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance. I had three. It was sort of the luck of the draw. But I will say that it always comes back to the same answer. The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people. I picked some great people, you know, but you don't think about that. I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked. I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked. And neocons. Yeah, neocons or bad people or disloyal.

[00:22:21]
People or people that were just.

[00:22:23]
People that were into the abuse of bad advice. Yeah, I mean, look. I mean, you reading about him a little bit today, a guy like Kelly, who was a bully. A bully, but a weak. A weak person, you know, you know more about bullies than anybody, probably around, because you deal in a certain sport where the bullies are exposed very quickly. But, you know, he's bad. Bolton was an idiot, but he was great for me because I'd go in with a guy like a John Bolton, you know, John Bolton. A friend of mine called me up. I was picking Bolton, and he's a very smart guy. His name is Phil Ruffin. He's a very rich guy from Las Vegas. One of the. He's a great card player. He doesn't play cards, but he's a great player. You know, he's just a natural. Got poker sense, right? You know, good old poker sense. And Phil Ruffin is a very, very wise kind of a guy and very. One of the richest people around and has had great success and understands people. So it was in that I was picking Bolton, or I picked Bolton. He called up, he said, don't pick him.

[00:23:24]
Why? He's a bad guy now. He wasn't in politics at all. He's in various businesses. He said, he's a bad guy. He's just. It always works out bad with that guy. And I said, oh, man, I wish you told me this two weeks ago. I already hired him. You know, he's here. And he was right, but he was good in a certain way. He's a nut job. And every time I had a deal with a country, when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, oh, man, Trump's going to Go to war with us. He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East. They should have never done it. I used to say it as a civilian. So I always got more publicity than other people. And I didn't. It wasn't like I was trying. In fact, I don't know exactly why. Maybe you can tell me why.

[00:24:14]
I could definitely tell you he said a lot of wild shoot. Maybe he said a lot of wild shoot. And then CNN in their all their brilliance by highlighting your wild shoot made you much more popular.

[00:24:26]
Yeah.

[00:24:26]
And they boosted you in the polls because people were tired of someone talking in this bullshoot pre prepared politician lingo. And even if they didn't agree with you, they at least knew whoever that guy is, that's him. That's really him. When you see certain people talk, certain people in the public eye, you don't know who they are. You have no idea who they are. It's very difficult to know. You see them in conversations, they have these pre planned answers. They say everything. It's very rehearsed. You never get to the meat of it. One of the beautiful things about you is that you free ball. Like you get out and you do these huge events and you're just talking and you're making. We've highlighted you on the show many times. When he did this Biden impression where he's walking around, he doesn't know what he's doing. It's funny, it's stand up, it's funny stuff. But it's like you and you were making fun of Elon one time, you were doing an Elon impression. It's great. You have comedic instincts. When you said to Hillary you'd be in jail, it's great timing, but it's like that kind of stuff was unheard of.

[00:25:28]
As a politician, no one had done that. And I think it's funny.

[00:25:32]
You need at least the attitude of a comedian when you're doing this business. This is a very dangerous business. First of all, it's a very tough business.

[00:25:41]
When it's the most dangerous business.

[00:25:42]
Yes. Well, for a job.

[00:25:44]
Yes. I mean, other than going to war and being a firefighter or being a cop. It's the most dangerous.

[00:25:50]
It's the most dangerous. Being president is the most dangerous.

[00:25:53]
Especially you. I mean, you haven't even got to the election. There's been two buttbuttination attempts and they've brushed those out of the news like it was nothing.

[00:26:02]
Yeah, they'd rather not talk about them.

[00:26:03]
Imagine if there was buttbuttination attempts on Biden. How hard people would be attacking the right. How they would be trying to get guns taken away from people. They would try to ramp up gun laws. They would try to figure out some way to blame you. If there was attacks on. If Biden got shot in the ear, we would have never heard the end of it.

[00:26:21]
But I think he's in good shape because it's only consequential presidents, if you take a look at what's happened, look, I'm for having countries pay us billions and billions and trillions, even dollars. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Nobody took in 10 cents, not one other president. I do things that make it. I mean, that don't necessarily make me so popular. I just do what's right. And when you do that, you know, you're more. Look at, look at Iran. We would have never had the attack on Israel at all. Iran was broke. I told China, if you buy, you can't do business in the United States under any circ. I was going to. We're going to go cold turkey with China. Some people think that would have been a good idea anyway. But if you buy any oil, one barrel of oil from them, you're not doing business. I said that to many countries. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hezbollah. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money. But I make myself, you know, I mean, I understand what I'm doing. You make yourself target, and it's a very dangerous business.

[00:27:22]
But if you just look at. Statistically. So I said, I saw a thing. I don't know if it's right, but 1/10 of 1% for a race car driver, it's pretty dangerous business, right? Yeah. 1/10 of 1% for a bull rider. I tell you, to me, I'm talking death. These guys that ride the bulls is worse than ufc. It's worse. These guys that you see these big monster bulls and you see it in slow motion where the foot is like, you know, an inch away from the head. If it hits him, the guy's gone, but they die. You know, they die.

[00:27:52]
So 1/10 of 1% die, what you're saying?

[00:27:54]
Yeah, 1/10 of 1% die.

[00:27:55]
Right.

[00:27:56]
And they certainly get hurt badly. Really. I mean, they can't walk after a certain period of time. But with a president, if you look.

[00:28:03]
At the amount of buttbuttination attempts.

[00:28:05]
And attempts, too. And attempts. No. It's a very dangerous position. I never thought of that, by the way, when I did it. You know, you don't, you don't tend to. Did you just buttume.

[00:28:14]
Because people Loved you on the Apprentice. They were going to love you as a president.

[00:28:16]
It would be so easy.

[00:28:18]
You know, it's probably would have been if the media didn't attack you the way they did, if they didn't conflate you with Hitler. I mean, even today, like Kamala was talking about you and Hitler, they're going to take what you said about Robert E. Lee. Oh, Donald Trump wishes the south won.

[00:28:33]
That's right. He loves Robert E. Lee.

[00:28:35]
They love to take things out of context and distort things.

[00:28:38]
They don't even have to take them out. They make them up entirely.

[00:28:41]
They do that too.

[00:28:42]
But you know, it's interesting when you mentioned the. I was very popular and all those people love me. I mean, some of these women, they're so stupid. And Joy, she would, every time she'd see me, like I'd be in the theater or something and she's. You have to be on the show again. Come on, come on, let's go. We have to.

[00:29:04]
She loved you.

[00:29:05]
She loved me.

[00:29:05]
That episode where, by the way, we'll be. People should watch that episode just to see what we're talking about. Like I said, we don't want to get a copyright strike, so we're not going to put it up. But if you watch the episode, it's bananas. It's like an alternative univers. And it's only nine years ago.

[00:29:19]
Whoopi loved you, loved you.

[00:29:21]
Gives you a hug and a kiss.

[00:29:22]
And how about that other one, the new one on there, the one from my administration. She writes me a letter. You're the greatest president. She leaves. You know, she worked as like an buttistant press secretary. I hardly knew her. But she leaves and she writes me this gorgeous letter. What's her name? She was, I don't even know, you know, anyway, she was in the administration. She's on now, currently sits in the far right hand side, whatever the hell her name is. And she writes a letter, the most beautiful letter. She's quoted in the paper, he's a consequential, he was the greatest president, blah, blah, blah. Then all of a sudden she goes interview. She starts hitting the hell out of me because they won't hire her unless I've had many people go on CNN and they call, said, I don't know what to do. They want to pay me a lot, but I have to be negative on you. I said, be negative. That's okay. There are guys on like cnn, they won't hire them. Sean Duffy is a, you know, congressman and he retired he got a good job with cnn, but he was only positive about Trump.

[00:30:20]
So they kept him, but they would never put him on. I mean, I respect what he did. He could have gone, you know, negative. I tell people, go negative. You know, let my friends make the money.

[00:30:30]
Well, it's.

[00:30:30]
It's so crooked. The press is so crooked.

[00:30:32]
It's crooked, but it's also. They're diminishing themselves. They're killing all their credibility. And it's opening up the credibility to new media. It's opening up the credibility to independent media. All these.

[00:30:43]
The worst I've ever seen, though. And I've seen the worst. I mean, I've been a part of it. I've been. I've seen the worst. Kamala goes on. 60 Minutes gave an answer that a child wouldn't give. It was so bad. And 60 Minutes took the answer out. They took the whole. And they put another answer in. They edited it deceptively, which didn't make sense either, but it was better. They took the. Well, it wasn't editing. It was fraud. This was not editing. You know, editing is where I'll give an answer and they'll take a couple of words and change them around, or they might even take a sentence or two off, which is very bad. But that's sort of bad. You know, I'd give an answer which was a very good answer. I always talk about, you know, I like to give long. The weave. You know, I like to give weave.

[00:31:26]
Yeah, you like to weave things in.

[00:31:27]
Yeah. But when you do the weaves, and you have to be very smart to do weaves. When you do the weave. Look at this. Just in this one thing. We're talking about little pieces all over here. But it always ends at home. No, no, it. Home for the right people, for the wrong people. It doesn't come back home. And they end up in the wilderness. Right. But they can take my answer. And you know what? They may take a little piece of it out or something. And they use the term. Yes, we wanted to save time. Well, it's not. But I've never heard. I think it's the biggest scandal in broadcast history. What happened to CBS? So you have CBS, 60 Minutes. That's a news program. It's not an entertainment program. It's under their news. It's the head of their news thing. She gives an answer that was. That shows that she's essentially incompetent. And they took the answer. Could you imagine them doing that?

[00:32:14]
We can show it. If you want people to see it can we show it. No, we get in trouble. We'll get copyright strike. Okay, I'll indemnify you, but it's drastic. But what was interesting was the other full version was available. Initially it was like a preview.

[00:32:31]
Somebody made a big mistake.

[00:32:32]
Somebody put that preview out there.

[00:32:33]
Some kid put the preview out.

[00:32:35]
Exactly.

[00:32:35]
And then the bosses did this or that. And then all of a sudden we got a problem.

[00:32:39]
Exactly.

[00:32:40]
And then they got caught by mistake. Well, don't you think that's a big. To me. And don't forget, this is election interference and fraud. And it's 60 Minutes. It's their news division.

[00:32:52]
So it's a big deal.

[00:32:54]
They give those licenses out, Joe, for free. They should pay a fortune. They're worth a fortune. They give them out for free because they're using the public airwaves. With cable, you don't have that. Cable's different, but, you know, it's just a different deal. But with the networks, they give those license. They're worth billions of dollars. They give them out free. But you have to be honest. And all that was bad. I think that David Muir and that woman that was aside, I never even heard of her. But they kept interrupting me. It was like I said, how many people am I debating here? I got this one and I got you two. But he went after me 11 different times. You know, it's interesting. I always thought he was a nice guy, but he's just like the rest of them, you know.

[00:33:35]
Well, that's his job, unfortunately, and I'm sure you're right. Well, the problem was they fact checked you and they didn't fact check her. And one of the most egregious examples of that was when she said that there is. There are no troops right now deployed in war zones. There's a very famous viral video that went online of troops in a war zone saying, well, what the freak are we then? Because there's thousands of them. Dan Crenshaw, the congressman, posted on his Instagram all of the various examples of troops that are deployed. Thousands and thousands of troops that are.

[00:34:11]
Currently deployed, stupidly deployed.

[00:34:12]
But the point is, if this is going to be an actual real debate and not a propaganda exercise, if it's going to be a real debate, you have to fact check everybody. Like if someone says thought there was no. Which is also a problem. So it's one of two things. It's either it was not true, it was a lie on purpose, which is terrible, or it was the opposite. It was ignorance, which is also terrible.

[00:34:35]
Well, Joe, When I said, crime is soaring, he said, no, no, crime has gone down. I said, where did he hear that one? Crime has gone down? I mean, I'm debating with this guy, but I've had that.

[00:34:45]
Well, there was amended FBI statistics that came out after that that showed the crime had gone up substantially.

[00:34:50]
And by the way, the statistics were a fraud. Because when they put out the statistics, they didn't include some of the worst places, they didn't include some of the worst cities, some of the most de. Deadly places. But when the real numbers came out, I turned out to be right. But I haven't.

[00:35:04]
You turned out to be right. But then there's another problem. Unreported crime is way up because people have lost. Look, the morale that the police department has in a lot of these cities where they've done this defund the police bullshoot, the morale, these poor cops, it's freaking horrible. It's the dumbest idea of all time. But what they've done is they've made these cops feel terrible, like good cops. I think cops are just like everybody else. Most of them are great. It's like everybody else. But if you run into one carpenter and he does a shootty job in your house, you say carpenters freaking suck. But they don't suck. Most of them are great. And that's the same thing with cops. But the point is, like, they. They did all of these things in this very foolish way, and these cops are suffering the consequences of it. And so subsequently, what happens is a lot of crime is unreported. A lot of crime. Like, you call the cops, they're too busy, they can't even get to you. Or your house got broken into. Sorry. You know, it doesn't even make a report. There's a lot of people that they just give up.

[00:36:00]
It's so sad what's happened. And I'll tell you what, I go to police funerals, and we went to one in Long Island. I visited the family in Long Island. A very big deal. It's so dangerous, people don't realize. The car, dark windows. Pull over. He's a gentleman. Please pull over. Door opens, guy comes out firing. Even if they were allowed to pull out their gun, which they're not, they can't, you know, pull out, do it in time. Yeah, they still wouldn't have time.

[00:36:29]
It's every cop's worst nightmare.

[00:36:31]
They open a door and he was killed, and his partner was hurt. He was killed. And you don't. I mean, you don't even have an eighth of a Second to think. And it is such a dangerous job that in particular, think of it. You go up to a car, you don't know who's sitting there with a gun, and if they have a gun, you really don't have a chance. You're not allowed to have your gun out, by the way. You have very strict rules. So number one there. But even if you could have your gun out, the door opens and bullets start firing out, you know, and especially where they have the dark windows, where they have the darkened windows. It is such a dangerous profession. And it's very hard to get cops now because they're not given any backup. And you're right, you know, they have like an eighth of a second to make a decision that's going to change their life. If they make the wrong decision, they're going to end up on the front page of every newspaper in the country, and they're going to lose their house and their pension and their job, and their wife is going to be gone, and everything is going to be gone.

[00:37:30]
Absolutely.

[00:37:30]
And here's another thing that people don't talk about. How many of them have ptsd? Probably most of them. These guys are seeing people shot all the time. I've talked to a ton of cops about it, and a lot of cops commit suicide. A lot of cops are deeply depressed.

[00:37:44]
But we have to give them back their dignity. We have to. We can't. We just have to give a back. You said it's so good. You never hear anybody say that. You're never going to have it perfect. You're going to have a bad apple.

[00:37:56]
In everything, in every profession.

[00:37:58]
But every time there's a bad apple, that gets mbuttive publicity and it taints everybody else.

[00:38:03]
But it's also this very irresponsible thing where people say, defund the police. Get rid of the police. You know, even Kamala Harris was a part of that. It's a very stupid way to look at it. What you should do is fund the police. You should have better training. You should have cops that feel more appreciated. You should have something that helps mitigate this PTSD that all of them suffer through.

[00:38:22]
She was a big part of Defund the police. That was a big thing for her. Defund the police. Always defund the police.

[00:38:29]
It's a political idea.

[00:38:30]
But anybody with that political thought I don't think should be running for president. And I think people are getting wise to it. You know, we're doing pretty well now. I don't know, maybe in a week from now, say, sorry about that. I was wrong. But we're leading everything, and I think we're going to have a very good election. But I tell people, because people are starting to get to know her. But she was defund the police. She was all these transgender operations. You know, if you wanted a cool change and you were in detention and you demanded a cool change, they would give you a cool change.

[00:39:01]
Well, the wildest one is this idea of giving free cool change to illegal immigrants.

[00:39:07]
That's right. In detention.

[00:39:09]
That is the wildest thing. Is that the biggest problem you have? You just walked here from Guatemala. You need to become a girl.

[00:39:16]
But she was in favor of it. Yes. So think of it now. She changed. She changed 15 policies. In fact, I'm going to send her a MAGA cap.

[00:39:24]
She stole your idea about no tax for tips.

[00:39:28]
I came up with this idea that honestly, nobody ever heard of. Now, it took her two months. But you know what? All of a sudden, well, it caught fire, and she just put it into a little speech. Yeah, Well, I think we have. I think we still have that issue. I think that issue is a good one for us. But, no, we have a lot of good issues. You know, we had the other day. Think of how simple some of these things are. We're trying to get cars built in the United States. Detroit has been really tough. It's been a disaster. They have a huge factory, a huge car auto plant being built by China in Mexico. Make cars, sell them in the United States. Put everybody out of business. Right, Here we go again. I said, if that plant is there when I'm president, I will put 100 or 200% tariffs on every car. They'll be unsalable in the United States. And they just announced they're not going to build the plan because they think I'm going to win. Think of it. They're not going to build the plant. This was the biggest plant in the world.

[00:40:19]
It would have more than all of Michigan makes. That's how big. You know, this is what we're getting to. And I said, if that plan goes up, I want them to understand if I win, I'm going to tax those cars at the rate of 100 or 200% apiece so that you won't be able to sell them in the United States. They just announced they're not going to build the plant.

[00:40:40]
Yeah, I read this.

[00:40:41]
I did a big favor for our country by doing that, and I'm not even there yet. To me, the most beautiful word. And I've said this for the last couple of weeks in the dictionary today. And is the word tariff. It's more beautiful than love. It's more beautiful than anything. It's the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use of tariffs. It'll.

[00:41:07]
Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?

[00:41:13]
Well, okay.

[00:41:13]
Were you serious about that?

[00:41:14]
Yeah, sure. But why not? Because we ready. Our country was the richest relatively in the 1880s and 1890s. A president who was buttbuttinated named McKinley. He was the tariff king. He spoke beautifully of tariffs. His language was really beautiful. We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price. And the big price is tariffs. And he'd speak like that. But he was right. And then around in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax. And you know why? Because countries were putting a lot of pressure on America. We don't want to pay tariffs. Please, don't you. You know, they believe me, they control our politicians. If you look at the kind of numbers that these guys make then and now. But we had a commission meeting in the. I think it was 1887. Think of this problem. We were so rich, we had so much money, we didn't know what to do. So they set up a blue ribbon commission on tariffs. And the sole purpose is what to do with all the money we had.

[00:42:31]
We were so rich because we were taxing other people for coming in and taking our jobs. And China does it. That's what China did. If you want to open a factory and sell cars, if you build a factory here or have a factory, they don't take our cars. They wouldn't take our cars. But if you build a plant in China, you can do that. Elon did that, by the way. Elon is great. That guy is such a great guy. I think you're a fan of Elon. He is from a different planet. He's the greatest guy. That rocket coming in, I told the story once or twice, so you may have heard it because his speeches have been good. Did you see the one last night?

[00:43:11]
Yeah.

[00:43:11]
29,000 people. That was it. And the one the night before was the same thing. We are. We are rocking and rolling, but Elon, and I'm talking to this very important guy. I say, wait a minute. I'm looking at something. The television's unmuted, right? And I see this rocket. It's all brown from the heat, you know, 10,000 degrees, pouring down at thousands of miles an hour. And I see this thing, you know, it's like a 20 story building.

[00:43:38]
And it catches.

[00:43:38]
And I say to this guy, he's an important guy. Wait a minute, let me just put you down. Hold it. I gotta see this. And I see this and it's going to crash. I say, it's going to crash into the gantry. They call it a gantry. I said, oh, man, that's going to be a disaster because it's starting to get very close. And then all of a sudden you see the flames and the bottom and it boom. And then you see the two arms grab it.

[00:44:00]
Crazy.

[00:44:01]
And I forgot the guy, I had him on the phone, I forgot. No, I said, the hell with it. No, I called Elon. I said, was that you? He said, that was me. And I said, who else can do that? He said, nobody. Russia can't do it. The United States. Nobody can do it. You know, I set up Space Force. That was me. And that's the first time in 82 years that we opened another branch since the Air Force. And that's going to be one of our most important things. But think of what Elon does. And he did one other thing that I never heard of it. It's Starlink. I went down to North Carolina, Georgia, the different places, right? I followed it right down and they had no communication. The polls were all knocked down, everything. And one of the guys in North Carolina said, could you do me a favor? Do you know Elon Musk? Yes, he endorsed me, by the way. He gave me the nicest endorsement, too. He said, the country's going to fail. You should do the same thing, Joe, because you cannot be voting for Kamala. Kamala, you're not a Kamala person.

[00:44:59]
I know you. I've watched you. I know him better than he is. You know what? Without speaking to you, I think I know you maybe almost as well as your wife. I have watched you for so many years. You're not a Kamala person. You're a Khabib person, but you're not a Kamala person. Nobody's going to know who Khabib is, but they know who he was. Not bad, right?

[00:45:19]
Oh, he was phenomenal.

[00:45:20]
But that's your kind of.

[00:45:21]
Your weave is getting wide. We're getting wide with this. I want to bring it back to tariffs.

[00:45:25]
But wait one second before we finish with tariffs. So they said, could you get him? We need Starlink. And I call Elon. He got it for him so fast. Saved so Many lives. And I said, how was it? They said, better than the wires, you know, they couldn't put them in. They were all. They were all gone. So getting.

[00:45:42]
I used it recently in Utah, in the mountains.

[00:45:44]
Did you find it good?

[00:45:45]
Oh, it's phenomenal. It's the size of a. Like an iPad. And you just set it down on the ground. You get high speed Internet. It's incredible.

[00:45:51]
We're spending. Just to show you. We're spending a trillion dollars to get cables all over the country, right up to upstate areas where you have like two farms. And they're spending millions of dollars to have.

[00:46:04]
Well, talk about those.

[00:46:05]
Elon can do it for nothing.

[00:46:06]
Billion dollars that was wasted on this Internet access program that they didn't get anybody.

[00:46:12]
They haven't hooked up. They haven't hooked up one person.

[00:46:14]
Not one person. They spent $42 billion. They could have gotten Starlinks to everybody.

[00:46:18]
With that kind of money for almost nothing.

[00:46:21]
Yeah.

[00:46:21]
For a monthly charge and it would have been incredible.

[00:46:23]
And it's the Internet everywhere you want to go.

[00:46:25]
And he wanted to do that.

[00:46:27]
And he wanted to do it.

[00:46:27]
How about this? They built the charger stations right in the Midwest. Midwest. They built eight of them. They cost $9 billion. That's like a gas pump. Right. They built nine gas pumps, except electricity comes out. They spent $9 billion. Three of them don't work. The whole thing. There's so much waste. I could sit here and tell you about things that there's so much waste, abuse and fraud.

[00:46:56]
Oh, there's. Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, I think everybody's aware of that.

[00:47:00]
Let's get back to terrorists.

[00:47:01]
When you're talking about. One of the criticisms of your administration was with tax cuts and with tariffs, you increased the deficit. So what was the strategy behind that? And did you think it was going to increase the deficit by a substantial amount?

[00:47:17]
Okay. We were ready to rock. It was all, you know, I had a bad system. We had horrible tax policy. I made it great with a much lower tax rate. So I took it from almost 40% down to 21%. Now I'm bringing it from 21 down to 15, but only if you make your product in the United States, which is great. People call me. They said, what a great idea. Nobody ever heard of that before. I don't care if they make the product in Japan. Why should I give up? So it's a 21 that at 21 in the first year, we took in much more revenue than we did at almost 40. Think of that. It inspired. Now we had other things too. We were able to get people to bring back their money. You couldn't bring back your money if you had money in Europe, like Apple. Apple had many billions of dollars outside, they couldn't bring it. There was no way to bring it back in. The bureaucracy, the documents, the whole thing. And also the tax was too high. You know, they wanted like half of it or something. Nobody's going to do that.

[00:48:19]
So they leave their money in Japan and they spend their money there. That was part of what I did. The money came pouring back in. Apple took in hundreds of billions of dollars. They brought it back from overseas. They brought it in.

[00:48:32]
So how does the deficit increase because of that?

[00:48:34]
So what happened is this. We were ready to rock and roll and then we had the COVID thing and we had to focus on that. And if we didn't give some businesses a hand, they would have all. You would have had a depression like in 1929. But we were ready to start. We were going to. We would have very shortly been paying off debt. You know, we have $35 trillion in debt. And I'll never forget it. We were. It was talking about from, you know, the standpoint of being in office. I'm in the Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin and Fabrizio. They're two very good pollsters, probably, I don't know, I would say the two best, who knows? But very good pollsters. And we're starting to think about running for a second term. And we had the greatest economy in history. Never has there been an economy.

[00:49:23]
And you attribute that to lowering taxes, tariffs, two things.

[00:49:27]
And also I cut regulations more than anybody else. And if I asked many of the businessmen, you know, from the big companies, you know, the guys running the big companies, I'd say, so if you had your choice, you've had it now for a long time. What's more important to you? The tax cuts? You paid less tax or the regulation cuts? Every one of them said the regulation cuts meant more. Who would think that? Right, because you don't equate it to dollars, but it actually is more dollars. We had it going and then we just had to focus on something else. But they were sitting there, these two pollsters were sitting there and they said, sir, if George Washington came back and Abraham Lincoln was his VP as opposed to Waltz, how bad is he, by the way? But if Abraham Lincoln was his vp, they couldn't beat you. You have got. And I'll never forget it, the following day, they said, something's happening in China. Sir, could we meet? I said what's happening? People are dying. And it was all around the Wuhan lab, by the way, there are pictures with little lines, their body bags all around the Wuhan lab.

[00:50:41]
And I always said that from the beginning, Joe was, you know, they tried to say, first they said it was France and they blamed everybody, but then they say it was bats from a cave 2,000 miles away. So we got hit with that. And despite that, we had the best economy. And when I gave it over, the stock market was higher than it was pre Covid. I mean, and nobody could even believe it, but we saved it and we were helping businesses. They were dying, you know, they were.

[00:51:10]
So it's your belief that if you had a second term, given the policies in place, the way the economy was booming, that you would have been able to pay off a lot of the debt. And that was the strategy.

[00:51:21]
We didn't have Covid. We would have been paying off debt and we would have had. And don't forget by growth, the word growth is actually more important than. Because you could have the same debt, but if you doubled your growth, all of a sudden you're under levered. But still we should pay off debt. You know, if you view this $35 trillion right now, it's a lot. But if you look at the buttet value, if you looked at it purely as an buttet value, we have oil underground, we have water, we have mountains, we have, I mean the buttets are so enormous. But regardless of that, we've got 35 trillion in debt. We should pay it off. And we would have started paying off debt and probably even giving further, given further tax reductions, I want to get it down to 15%. We're going to do more business. But when you get hit with a Covid, everything stops and you have to keep these businesses alive. The businesses were dying. I mean they were just dying. This whole place, this country was going to die.

[00:52:19]
Are there influences outside of environmental that keep people from wanting to drill for oil and frack and do those sort of things outside of the environmental concerns which are legitimate, of course, but are there other influences that maybe over accentuate or over exaggerate these environmental effects? Are people being influenced in a way where they're trying to keep us from producing American oil? Yeah, yeah.

[00:52:47]
So the environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth. The biggest tool. The other is regulation. And if you speak to Elon, he said the regulation now to send a rocket up to anywhere, even if you do everything, it's almost, it's Becoming impossible. But they use environmental in order to get people not to do anything. And sometimes I say, you know, I look at some of the. I know the environmental stuff better because I had to build buildings in New York. I had to do environmental impact studies. And I would see some of these guys that I'd hire for a lot of money, environmentalists, that would get you through the process. And they'd be up in Albany, that's the capital of New York, and they're up there trying to make it tougher for guys like me that were builders, because they'd get paid more money. In other words, I had one guy highly recommended. You know, I was good at getting permits. I was one of the kings of. I was always very good. But the environmental stuff was always horrible. They could slow a project down 10 years, 15 years. I had a project in Louisiana, build big LNG plant.

[00:53:58]
It was for 14 years. It was going to cost $18 billion. One of the biggest, like the Empire State Building laying down on its side times 4 mbuttive in the coast, on the Gulf Coast. And they said, sir, they're going to give it up. I said, they shouldn't give it up. What's the problem? They can't get their environmental. They had environmental permits that would fill this whole room up to the ceiling. And they said there was one mistake on one little line, they wanted to do it all over again. It's not going to happen. And I got them their permit instantly, and they built the plant. It's mbuttive.

[00:54:34]
So when you're saying that. So there's people that are making money by making it difficult.

[00:54:39]
Yeah.

[00:54:39]
Are you talking about lawyers?

[00:54:41]
No, I'm just talking about environmental consultants and lawyers.

[00:54:44]
Environmental consultants profit off of dragging out the process.

[00:54:48]
Absolutely. And then make the process worse.

[00:54:50]
How do they process?

[00:54:51]
And I'd probably do the same thing if I were them, to be honest with you. You know, I want to be honest with you.

[00:54:55]
How do they do that? How do they make it, let's say, New York?

[00:54:58]
They go to Albany, okay? And they convince people that if you have a certain type of plant on the ground that's this big and in theory, valueless, that it's a rare plant and you cannot even touch it. You can't go near it, you can't put a building on it, you can't do anything, or there's a little puddle and they call it a lake. And you have to go by the standards of a lake. I said, no, no, that's a puddle. Oh, you have no idea. Guys are filling a Little puddle. You have no idea what they do. And they use it as a way to stop you.

[00:55:31]
They use it as a way to stop you and also as a way to generate money. I'm curious how they're generating money that way though.

[00:55:37]
Well, they get fees. They get fees, mbuttive fees.

[00:55:40]
And people rely on them as experts because they're the people that they go to when they have to run these studies in the first.

[00:55:47]
Some of them are just bad guys and they're trying to make it more.

[00:55:50]
And more difficult and they have a lot of power.

[00:55:52]
Yeah, I think they maybe had more. They didn't have as much with me because I would get through them and I understood it. Look, I've had, I've done so many. They call it environmental impact study. I did so much to build a building. To build a building in New York is very tough. You gotta be very, you gotta deal with, think of it, financing unions, all the municipal stuff. Environmental of all of it. To me the toughest thing was the environmental. Because they could stop you cold with the environmental impact study stuff. And you hire a so called expert, they say, sir, he's the one guy, he can get you through the morbutt. It's a morbutt. It's horrible. They use it as a weapon. They use it all over the country.

[00:56:35]
Right, but there are legitimate concerns about environmental impact. Correct? Look, about the BP oil spill, there's a lot of things that do happen that are environmentally devastating and you want to mitigate that as much as possible.

[00:56:47]
Look, I had, during our four years, we had the cleanest air and the cleanest water. I view it differently. I say air and water. Remember this, it costs much more to do things environmentally clean. China doesn't do anything.

[00:57:02]
Right.

[00:57:02]
When Kerry goes to see President Xi of China, which he probably doesn't even get to see him, but they look at them. Oh yes, yes, we will do. Oh yes, yes, we're going to do that. No more coal. No more coal. Just. And then they approve 58 coal plants for the next, you know, every. They build a coal plant a week.

[00:57:20]
Okay, they build a lot of coal plants. We've covered.

[00:57:22]
But let me just tell you though, so here we are cleaning and scrubbing everything and everything's got to. The year's got to be pure. But in 3.8 days, that stuff floating over China is right over the top of us, right? Same thing with the oceans. They dump their garbage into the Pacific Ocean. If you take a little cork and put it there in about a week and a half, it'll be in front of Los Angeles. We're picking up their garbage. So nobody ever talks about that, but in a way, the bigger one is even the air. It's the currents. It's an amazing thing. It's been flowing that way for a million years. Long before. Long before.

[00:58:02]
With the whole world. Yeah.

[00:58:04]
No, if we're cleaning, we get the.

[00:58:05]
Sahara dust clouds over here.

[00:58:07]
Absolutely.

[00:58:08]
We get dust clouds in Austin from the Sahara Desert.

[00:58:10]
But we get the China. You know, they call it the China curse. We get the China curse. They're better and their air is dirty. You know, when I went there, I had a great relationship with President Xi. We got along very well, and they treated me better than anybody has ever been treated. Same thing with Saudi Arabia, a number of them. But they laid it out and I said, this air is good. Do you know they closed every factory one week before I got there? From within 200 miles.

[00:58:40]
That's like what Gavin Newsom did when Xi Jinping came to San Francisco.

[00:58:43]
He cleaned it up.

[00:58:44]
He cleaned it up. He got rid of all.

[00:58:45]
Isn't that terrible? In a way, to think, you know, he cleaned it up and then it became a pigsty.

[00:58:51]
Well, the dumbest thing is he said, when your friends come by, when you have visitors, you clean up your house. Like, how about just keep your freaking house clean?

[00:58:58]
Can you imagine?

[00:58:59]
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard anybody say, ever, as a governor, as to excuse to why you finally cleaned up your homeless problem.

[00:59:05]
And the day he left, right back. It went right back. But in a way, that was a bad thing that he did because he showed what a disgrace that was. What a disgrace.

[00:59:16]
Well, this is the thing that, like, shows you how foolish a lot of these people that are running these cities think. A lot of these people that are running these states think it's foolish. Like, you're insulting the intelligence of the people that live in that city that are impacted by these people just camping and needles and human feces. There's an app that you can buy. There's an app that you can get rather, that will show you where the human feces has been documented in San Francisco. It's a poo app. And it's just everywhere. It's just bum crowd everywhere.

[00:59:48]
But let me give you one that you may not know, okay? Which I think you know everything, actually, as a student of yours. But water, you know, in Los Angeles, you can't get proper amounts of water, right? And it's unbelievably expensive, and you might have a House in Beverly Hills. And they're actually thinking about rationing water. Can you believe it?

[01:00:10]
I can believe.

[01:00:12]
I was in the farm court country with some of the congressmen, were driving up a highway, and I say, how come all this land is so barren? It's farmland, and it looked terrible. It was just brown and bad. I said, but there's always that little corner that's so green and beautiful. They said, we have no water. I said, do you have a drought? No, we don't have a drought. I said, why didn't you have no water? Because the water isn't allowed to flow down. It's got a natural flow from Canada all the way up north. More water than they could ever use. And in order to protect a tiny little fish, the water up north gets routed into the Pacific Ocean. Millions and millions of gallons of water gets poured. You got to see this. We're driving up, and I had never seen it before. It's the most. It's like Iowa. It's the most fertile land. Iowa is blessed with great land. Idaho for a potato, right? But these, they're just. By the way, you know, some land is good for a potato, some land is good for corn. It's the craziest thing. I love the farmers.

[01:01:16]
They're great. They're the greatest. And by the way, they're getting killed right now.

[01:01:19]
They are.

[01:01:20]
They're getting killed because of this stupid administration. But so I see this, and I said, you gotta be kidding. I said, you mean you have water? And I looked at it. It's like a valve in your sink, except it's mbuttive. The thing's five times taller than your ceiling.

[01:01:34]
Did you know the center of California was a giant lake?

[01:01:38]
They have so much water.

[01:01:39]
You ever see what it looks like before they rerouted the center of California? Like, was it 200 years ago? How long ago did they do that, Jamie? The center of California had a freaking enormous lake in the middle of California.

[01:01:51]
So they dumped it into the Pacific.

[01:01:53]
Who knows what they did. But whatever foolishness that they did led to the situation that they're in now.

[01:01:59]
Think of those dry forests that burn down all over the world. You know, the head of Austria said.

[01:02:05]
Tulare Lake, or Tachi Lake. It's a freshwater lake in the southern San Joaquin Valley, United States. Historically, Tulare Lake was one of the largest freshwater lakes west of Mississippi. Show a photo of what it looked like back then.

[01:02:20]
That's a great system.

[01:02:21]
So that's what it looked like. Look at that image now, the one. Go to the one on the third from the right.

[01:02:25]
Yeah.

[01:02:25]
Yeah. That was an enormous lake in the middle of California. Imagine that.

[01:02:29]
That'd be much more valuable property.

[01:02:30]
How crazy is that? But how crazy is that what it used to look like? And human beings screwed that.

[01:02:35]
No, they let it go into the Pacific, and then they.

[01:02:37]
I don't know what they did. What did they do that? Why did. How did it go missing?

[01:02:42]
Yeah, they drained it.

[01:02:44]
19. 1983. Oh, my God. It went dry a handful of times. Oh, went dry a handful of times. Well, you know, lakes do go dry, but that's a big one. But think of it.

[01:02:56]
You could have all of the water you need. All of that land would have more water. The whole thing could be like that little patch. Literally, I'd say. I was with Devin Noon as a congressman and other congressmen. We were going up. I was visiting that. Because they asked me to go up and visit their territory, and I did. But I kept saying, look at this land. It's beautiful, but it's so dry. And I thought they were going through, like a desert, like a drought. They said, no, we have water, but it gets. So I looked into it.

[01:03:23]
What is the face?

[01:03:24]
And I got it done. I got it done. I could have water for all of that land. Water for your forests. You know, your forests are dry as a bone. Okay.

[01:03:33]
Dangerous.

[01:03:34]
That water could be routed. You know, you could have everything. Oh, dang. Not only dangerous. Billions of dollars a year they spend on forest fires. And, you know, there's a case with the environment. They're not allowed to rake their forests because you're not allowed to touch it. When a tree falls down after 18 months, it becomes very dry. It's like, you know, like real firewood. It's bad. You know, a tree that's up. These are all things I learned the hard way, the easy way. But when a tree is up, it sucks water. It's wet. I went to that. They had a couple of horrible forest fires in California. And I went. I said, you know, you had a lot of trees standing yesterday. Were healthy trees, sir. I said, with this intense heat that you could see they were charred a little bit on the bottom. But they were going to be all right because they're soaking wet, because they suck up the water. Right. But when they fall, they're like, you know, it's like lighting a match.

[01:04:23]
Yeah.

[01:04:24]
And you got to be able to clean. They call. Maintain your forest. So I was with the head of Austria. He said, you know, it's a shame. I see all Those forest fires in California, and all they have to do is clean their forest, meaning rake it up, get rid of the leaves. Get rid of, you know, leaves that are sitting there for five years. And they, well, certainly get rid of.

[01:04:42]
The dead fall and get rid of.

[01:04:43]
The trees that have fallen, you know, are like so many things this country.

[01:04:50]
By the way, could you rake all the forest, though? I don't think you could rake the whole forest. I think you get rid of the dead fall. But raking all the weeds, you could.

[01:04:57]
Certainly get rid of the dead. Okay.

[01:04:58]
I think that's the real issue, you.

[01:04:59]
Know, environmentally, they don't want to do that. They said, you know, it's got to be nature and all this stuff. But in the meantime, this is Exactly. But you could have. So it was the Department of Commerce that needed the approvals, but Gavin Newsom had to sign them. I got it all done. Nobody could believe it. It was all done. I said, I got it. You got so much water, all you have to do is sign. And that guy didn't want to sign.

[01:05:27]
Did he not want to sign? Because that would be a political victory for you, I think.

[01:05:30]
No, he didn't. No, I don't think so. You know, he used to say he's a great president. And we got along. We did. We actually got along at that point. But I think somebody said, you just can't continue to call him a great president. You know, they do say that, but we had it all done. He didn't sign, and then we got onto other things. And every time I go to California, he said, you have so much water, they don't know it. I'm telling you, people living in Beverly Hills, they turn off the water. Same thing with the electric. They want to go to all electric cars, but they have brownouts every weekend, you know.

[01:06:04]
Well, right after they made the announcement that as of 2035, you're not going to be able to buy an internal combustion engine in California. Like, within a month, they had some announcement asking people to not charge their Teslas because the grid couldn't handle it. Well, how are you going to handle it?

[01:06:19]
I will terminate the mandate immediately. This amendment. That will be done, I would say, in my first day, maybe two days, because, you know, let me ask you about nuclear.

[01:06:28]
One of the things that, when I've talked to people that have a real understanding of nuclear power, what their position is, it's probably the cleanest, safest form of electricity that we could generate, and that the fears of nuclear power are really about a few Disasters, the Fukushima Three Mile island and that these are old systems and that they're much more capable now and they're capable of making even better systems. But it's a difficult political issue because you think nuclear power, you think Chernobyl, that's what everybody does. They have this connection, they have the potential Fukushima, which is Fukushima where you're.

[01:07:07]
Not supposed to enter the land for 3,000 years or something.

[01:07:11]
I think it's worse than that. I think that area is like going to be radioactive for probably longer than you could imagine. But the point is they're better at it now and that they could do it now. And you can generate power in a way that you don't have to worry about these. One of the most ridiculous things is electric cars being powered by coal fired plants. It's a ridiculous thing.

[01:07:32]
So it's happening.

[01:07:33]
Yeah, it is what's happening. And people want to think they're being green, you know, but it's.

[01:07:37]
Well, if you look at the way the battery is made. But here's the other thing. We don't have. Well, we do actually. It's being held, you know, we have certain areas where we have great raw earth material and we're not allowed to use it because of the environment. And we have areas in California that have incredible raw earth and they're not allowing. And I'm going to open it up, I'm going to let them use it.

[01:07:58]
But how do you do that? China, how do you do that and protect the environment?

[01:08:01]
Because the environment is going to be protected. You can do it. You can make a lake out of it. Okay, we'll put back a lake. I mean, and something nice about lakes. You can do things magnificently.

[01:08:10]
You just have to do it carefully and responsible.

[01:08:12]
Absolutely, you have to do it carefully. But the problem, you know, China has all of those areas, most of those areas. And yet when they say go electric with the cars, China is going to be the one that gives us the cars. All of those guys in Detroit are going to be out of business. You're going to make your electric cars over there. We have a thing called gasoline and we have more oil and gas under our feet than any other nation. You know, I had in Alaska, there's a find, it's called anwar. I got it approved. Reagan couldn't get it. Nobody could get it. I got it all done. It was amazing. They were getting ready to start drilling. The equivalent they think of Saudi Arabia. One of the biggest finds in the world. It was all set to go. And Biden comes in, one of his first orders were, we're not going to use it. It would have been so good for the. We could have supplied all of Asia with oil and gas.

[01:09:05]
What was the. What was the negative?

[01:09:06]
And you talk about money, right? The negative was politically, they didn't think it was good for them. That's all.

[01:09:11]
That's all it was. So you don't think that it's environmentally.

[01:09:13]
Dangerous, taking it from way down deep in the earth? Environmentally would have been fine.

[01:09:18]
So it can be done responsibly.

[01:09:20]
Absolutely.

[01:09:20]
Oh, otherwise the environment.

[01:09:22]
Well, I think windmills, okay, so they talk about windmills. I think windmills are really disruptive when you talk about the environment. They kill the birds. You want to see a bird cemetery go under a windmill someday that hasn't been cleaned out with all the bird carcbuttes? It's like mbuttive amounts of windows.

[01:09:40]
Well, they're also a mbuttive eyesore. I went to a ranch in South Texas. We had to drive past this enormous windmill farm. And it's gross. It's dystopian. You're looking in the left and the right, and all you see is these big spinning machines that aren't even that effective generating electricity.

[01:09:57]
Most expensive form of electricity is a windmill. And then they start to rust and rot, and you have to. And then they get abandoned by the people that built them because you have.

[01:10:06]
To get rid of all that material, too. When you replace those blades, now you have a problem because you have to dispose, right? You have to dispose. These enormous windmills. And how.

[01:10:15]
The way they say you can't bury them. So I even question that. But I'm not going to get into it. But they say you can't bury the bus. So you have the blades, and you can't bury the blades. You can bury the blades. It's not going to matter. You can bury the. You'll find areas you can bury. But they come up. This is what I mean. They come up with this. But the environmentalist dream is windmills. Everyone. You know what happens to them after five years? They start to rot after 10 years, you have to replace them. Did you ever look at certain parts of California where they have heavy windmills and they've been abandoned? And they're all different manufacturers in all different companies, and they all.

[01:10:48]
I haven't seen that.

[01:10:48]
It is the ugliest thing. It looks like a graveyard, almost a graveyard of windmills.

[01:10:54]
It's pollution.

[01:10:54]
It's so bad.

[01:10:56]
And in the oceans, it's no different than leaving garbage on the Ground.

[01:10:59]
How about in New Jersey? Off the coast of New Jersey, they want to build. The. People are going crazy not to build them, but we have them. The whales are washing up on shore, right? So in 50 years, they had one whale come ashore. Now they had like 18 come in the last year.

[01:11:16]
What is the. What is happening with the whales? I've read about this.

[01:11:19]
Well, they say that the wind drives them crazy. You know, it's a vibration because you have the. You know, Those things are 50 story buildings, some of them.

[01:11:25]
Right. And they're super sensitive to vibrations.

[01:11:29]
You know, the wind is rushing, the things are blowing. It's a vibration and it makes noise. You know what it is? I want to be a whale psychiatrist. It drives the whales freaking crazy and something happens with them. But for whatever reason, they're getting washed up on shore and, you know, and.

[01:11:46]
Yet the environment conveniently ignored by the environment.

[01:11:48]
Yeah, but the environmentalists, they don't talk about. I think there's nothing uglier. I see it in Scotland. I see it all over the world. You have this beautiful valley. It's been there for, you know, in civilization thousands of years, but millions of years, and all of a sudden you have these ugly windmills up.

[01:12:05]
Would your plan to be replaced that with nuclear? What would you do?

[01:12:08]
Well, nuclear is better. I mean, I think there's a little danger to nuclear, but, you know, we had some really bad nuclear. They did one in Alabama. They did one in, I think, South Carolina. They do them wrong. They build these mbuttive things. Then the environmentalists get. I don't want to go into a long story because it's too long for this show. This show is too valuable to talk about concrete. But they have hardened concrete. It's number 12 concrete. It's the hardest. It's harder than steel. It's incredible. They put up a wall and an inspector comes along. Nope, nope. You're a quarter of an inch. The wall might be 8ft wide. You're a quarter of an inch too short. I'm sorry. You got to rip down the wall. You got to. Because it's got to be poured contiguously. Right. You're one quarter of an inch. I'm sorry, Ripped down. You can't rip it down. This stuff. You can't put a hammer through it. You can't. It's incredible. Concrete technology is unbelievable. You know what's happened? You think of concrete, so you think.

[01:13:02]
That'S an example of overregulation. Pointless.

[01:13:04]
You have an inspector that comes along and he says, take down a 25 zillion dollar wall. These things ended up costing 25 billion dollars and one of them never got opened. But here's the story. So France does it. France is largely nuclear. And they build small little compact plants and if they need more, they build the same thing. And they hook it up. And they hook it up because they get too big and too complex and too expensive. And it is very clean. They say it's absolutely. You know, my uncle, I had a great uncle who was a great genius, just like other members of my family. But he was a professor at MIT for I think 41 years. He was the longest. When I was in the White House, the head of mit, Princeton and Harvard came down to meet me and the MIT person said, I have a book on your uncle. Dr. John Trump. He was our longest serving professor. He was a great genius, sir. Do you know how? And he had, he knew everything about, about nuclear, from math to chemistry to nuclear. He knew it. And he said, someday it's going to be the way to go.

[01:14:14]
But the problem is it's so dangerous in terms of war. He said, donald, somedayand this was a long timeUncle John, Dr. John Trump, he said, someday you'll have a little satchel at your side and you'll go into a building and you'll be able to blow up New York City. I said, uncle John, that'll never happen. He's right. You know, he's right.

[01:14:35]
Well, that was the problem, giving nuclear power to other countries, right? Like that was the problem that happened with India and Pakistan. They got nuclear power and then they were able to weaponize it.

[01:14:47]
The biggest problem in the world today is not global warming, it's nuclear warming. And we have idiots that are negotiating for us. We have a guy that doesn't make it past 4:00 and it's not because of age. You know, they ought to. I know so many guys in their late 80s and they're better than. I said to one guy the other day, I think you're smarter than you were 25 years ago. I've known him a long time. He's 89 years old. He's sharp as. I mean, he's great. Biden gives people a bad name because that's not an old, that's not an age. I think they say it because I'm three or four years younger. You know, I think that's why they say it. They say his age. It's not his age. He's got a problem.

[01:15:24]
Two major brain surgeries.

[01:15:26]
He did, he did. Those are not Good operations.

[01:15:29]
And do you see what he did today? He went running towards the camera and made some apology to Native Americans. And he said, that's why he's headed out west, like he's off the reservation, so to speak, for lack of a better term.

[01:15:43]
You know, it's interesting because during the debate, I was looking over him saying, hmm, this is strange. Like, strange things were happening. Yeah, but.

[01:15:54]
Well, he couldn't keep it together. But do you think they knew he couldn't keep it together?

[01:15:57]
I think so.

[01:15:57]
Do you think that they wanted. Is that why, like, historically, that debate was earlier than they've been in the past? Right.

[01:16:04]
I think they wanted to get. Well, there's a lot of theories. A lot of people said, do the debate now and we'll get him out.

[01:16:09]
Right.

[01:16:10]
I think that maybe could be.

[01:16:11]
Well, that is what happened.

[01:16:14]
I think they also said, do the debate now and get it over with.

[01:16:17]
Right.

[01:16:18]
I don't think anybody thought he was going to get out, really.

[01:16:21]
It didn't make any sense.

[01:16:22]
The debate got him out. But I think it's very unfair. Look, you have a bad debate, his numbers went down. But I think she's not doing very well right now, and I think she looks well.

[01:16:34]
I want to get to that, too, because it's hard to know. Like, the whole poll thing is very bizarre for most people because most people don't answer polls, so they read the polls.

[01:16:41]
Were you ever called?

[01:16:43]
If I did, I'd hang up.

[01:16:44]
I was never called by a poll.

[01:16:45]
If I did, I wouldn't answer. I'm busy.

[01:16:47]
You know how polls are done. Oh, I'm going to get myself in trouble. But. So I really don't believe too much in him, so.

[01:16:54]
Well, 2016 taught a lot of people about the ineffective.

[01:16:57]
Well, they were very ineffective because I thought I was doing well. I'd go to a place and I'd have 30, 40,000 people. Hillary would go, they have 500 people. And they'd tell me, I'm going to lose. I said, why am I going to lose? I had 40,000 people. She had 200 people. But, you know, I have a theory. These pollsters, they charge you a lot of money, too, you know, they charge you half a million bucks to do some stupid poll and they interview, like, 251 people. I don't think they interview him in many cases. I don't want to get myself in too much trouble.

[01:17:22]
You think it's bullshoot?

[01:17:24]
No, I think they sit there, they make a deal, they get a half a million bucks and they say Trump's leading 51 to 49, they announce it and everybody says, oh, do you understand? I don't think they. I think in a lot. Look, I'm a very common sense person. I think that they probably don't always poll. Some of them probably never poll. What's the difference between 49 to 51 and 47 and a half?

[01:17:51]
Well, it's also a tiny percentage of the population. I don't think it's representative of the overall population. I just don't think.

[01:17:58]
I don't know of one person in my whole life that ever got called by a pollster.

[01:18:02]
Exactly. That's my point. So here's my question.

[01:18:07]
But I shouldn't say that because I'm doing very, you know, really well in the polls.

[01:18:10]
But I think that's.

[01:18:10]
So this week, I happen to believe in a verse. I only believe they're good. No, I like them this month, but no, I honestly believe that there's probably a lot of fraud. I had a poll, Washington Post, abc. In the Hillary thing on Wisconsin, they had me down 17 points. The day before the election, I knew it was wrong because I had a rally, I had 29,000 people at a racetrack, and it was like 0 degrees Wisconsin. And they had me down 17 points. In other words, you had no chance. And I won. And I called up my pollsters. Good guy, good guy. And I believe he's legitimate. And, you know, and some of them are. And some of them are. I said, tell me, why did they have me down so much? I mean, nobody's going to believe them the next time. They said they don't care. When you're down 17 points, people are going to stay home. They're not going to vote, because they're going to say, I love Trump, but I'm not going to waste my time. It's cold out. I said, but what do they make at 4 or 5? He said, At 4 or 5, they're going to go and vote.

[01:19:09]
At 17, they're not going to go and vote. Think of it. I was seven. This is the Washington Post ABC poll. I was down 17 points in Wisconsin and I won. It's crooked stuff.

[01:19:21]
There's a lot of crooked stuff. And I wanted to talk about that, too, because one of the things that people talk about with you is the denial of the results. And I think J.D. vance did a brilliant job the other day when he was being interviewed and they asked him, did Trump lose the 2020 election? And he turned it around and said, was there legitimate election interference in Suppressing the Hunter Biden laptop story on social media. And was that a concerted effort?

[01:19:50]
Well, they say it made 10 point difference, and I lost by 1/10 of a point. They say it was 22,000 votes. But look, it was much more than that. And I appreciate J.D. van saying that. And by the way, I think he was a great pick. Do you like jd?

[01:20:06]
I like him a lot. Yeah.

[01:20:07]
You're allowed to say that.

[01:20:08]
No, I do. I like him. I think he's a brilliant guy, and I think his ability to talk like a normal human being. He did. You did my friend Theo Vaughn's podcast, and he just did it.

[01:20:17]
How did he do it?

[01:20:18]
He did great. And he just talks about a human being.

[01:20:21]
Is that why you called me to do this?

[01:20:23]
No, no, I was.

[01:20:26]
He was a nice thing.

[01:20:27]
Shot you. I was like, he's got to come in here. It's all about time, timing. It's all about the timing.

[01:20:31]
Timing.

[01:20:31]
I think timing's perfect. Do you even have a scar on your ear? You got anything on there?

[01:20:34]
I do.

[01:20:35]
Let me say.

[01:20:36]
So right over here. It zicked right there.

[01:20:43]
It's. It healed up pretty good.

[01:20:45]
Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah. It's little. It's not like some of the wrestlers, some of the UFC fighters.

[01:20:50]
No, you didn't get.

[01:20:52]
No, no, it got. It was sort of like a top shot. The point of the bullet was a little of the s. But you see the things taken off a little bit. But it makes me a tougher guy. You know, the fighters. You know, the fighters love there. You know, Bo Nickell He's a great fighter.

[01:21:08]
Yeah, I love Bo Nickel.

[01:21:09]
How's he going to do? I think he's true.

[01:21:10]
He's great. He's a fantastic wrestler.

[01:21:11]
He was almost like undefeated in college.

[01:21:13]
Yeah, he's a fantastic wrestler and one of the best mixed marshals.

[01:21:16]
What is he fighting again?

[01:21:17]
He's fighting in Madison Square Garden in November.

[01:21:20]
Oh, that's going to be an interesting. After the election.

[01:21:22]
Yep.

[01:21:23]
So I'll either go as president or I'll be depressed and I won't bother going. Yeah, I think they're having a fight right after.

[01:21:30]
One of the things that was fascinating also was the denial of the election results is a pretty common thing. Hillary Clinton famously denied that she called you an illegitimate president, and she said that Russia put you in place even though she conceded. Yes.

[01:21:44]
You know, she conceded the night of the election because she was beaten.

[01:21:47]
Yes. And it was a thing that was pretty common for people, especially Democrats, to deny the elections, there's been many of them. The Bush administration, the, you know, the dangling chads, all that stuff.

[01:22:00]
Well, look at these guys in Congress, all these sleazebags in Congress that are Democrats, they're still denying 2016, but now they don't so much because, you know, they try and pin it on me. You don't hear them say, but here's my point. But they denied it right up until the end.

[01:22:13]
My point is this idea of election fraud is a forbidden topic. And you get labeled an election denied. It's like being labeled an anti vaxxer. If you question some of the health consequences that people have had from the COVID 19 shots, oh my God, you're an anti vaxxer. If you say. And what I say publicly, and I've said this a lot, it's not zero percent. So if you ask me, what is the amount of election fraud in this country, is it 0%? No one thinks it's 0%. I've never met one person, not a super liberal progressive, far left person or a right wing conservative, not one person thinks it's zero percent. They think when you have human beings, and also you have a lot of weirdness that was going on during the 2020 elections, particularly with mail in ballots.

[01:23:03]
And you had legislatures that had to approve and they didn't approve and they went out and did it anyway. And you had ballot, you had old fashioned ballot screwing. I mean, you had, you have people going up and dropping in phony votes. You had unsigned ballots, et cetera, et cetera.

[01:23:19]
There's certain people that, remember, I lost my. And the rhetoric is also that you're Hitler and that in order to stop Hitler, you have to do whatever it takes.

[01:23:27]
That was okay.

[01:23:28]
Yeah, yeah. And this is, I mean, you're hearing this now. Kamala compared you to said your love of Hitler yesterday.

[01:23:33]
It's, you know, Kamala is a very low IQ person. She's a very low iq. You know, I'm for taking tests too. I think anybody that runs for president should take. They should give him tests. And it's not an age thing. It's not based. If you look back on history, 70s and 80s, some of your greatest leaders in the world, world history, long time world history. They were in their 70s and their 80s. But I think you should take cognitive tests. I think everybody, they say it's unconstitutional.

[01:24:02]
But I think that's ridiculous.

[01:24:03]
I think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing. There's something wrong with her.

[01:24:07]
Well, I think it's Pressure, I think the pressure and the scrutiny. You've been a celebrity for a long time, and you understand what this is like. But for someone who's in her late 40s, who becomes the vice president, who runs for president, becomes the vice president, and then all of a sudden, the weight of the world is on your shoulders, and there's all these people paying attention. A lot of people clam up, but.

[01:24:25]
You either have it or you don't.

[01:24:27]
Correct.

[01:24:27]
Look, this is an interview. We've covered a lot of territory, right? And, you know, it's fine. I don't care. I want to. I think it's much more interesting, she. To do an interview with Anderson Cooper, a softball, crazy softball interview. She took two days off, and she studied and studied all day long, and then she comes out with a result that was a real embarrbuttment. That was a really bad interview. She couldn't answer a question. And every question is not answered. I mean, like, what would you do your first day in office? Okay, I'll build a wall. I won't build a wall. There's a hundred things you can say. Just say anything, right? There's something off with her.

[01:25:08]
Well, I.

[01:25:10]
We're dealing with the smartest people. They hate when I say. You know, when the press. When I call President Xi, they said, he called President Xi brilliant. Well, he's a brilliant guy. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. I mean, he's a brilliant guy whether you like it or not. And they go crazy.

[01:25:25]
Right. It doesn't mean he's not evil or. It doesn't mean he's not. Yeah, of course not dangerous.

[01:25:29]
But. But actually, we have evil people in our country.

[01:25:32]
Yes.

[01:25:33]
If you have a smart president, he can deal with Russia. He can deal with all of it. I had a. Russia would have never gone into Ukraine. If I were president, how would you have stopped it? Automatic. Two things I told him. I said, vladimir, you're not going in. I used to talk to him all the time. You're not going in. I can't tell you what I told him because I think it would be inappropriate, but someday he'll tell you. But he would have never gone in. But you know why else he wouldn't have gone in? Oil prices at $40 a barrel wouldn't have allowed him. Wouldn't have given him the money to prosecute that war. Wouldn't have given him the money. I said it with President. I was with President Xi. I said, it was almost the same conversation. With Vladimir, it was Moscow. With President Xi, it Was Beijing. It was almost the exact same conversation. I said, don't do it. He would have never done it. The day I left, they flew 28 bombers over the middle of. Of Taiwan. 28 bombers. And it's the apple of his eye. And the same thing with Russia.

[01:26:35]
It's the apple. Ukraine is the apple of his. I used to talk to him. I had a very good relationship with him. He wouldn't have done it. He would have never done it. But he also wouldn't have done it because of the. You know, one of the reasons that what happened is, number one, he doesn't respect Biden at all, not even a little bit. And who the hell would. But he doesn't respect him. But when he saw what happened in Afghanistan, how horribly that was handled. Number one, you take the soldiers out last, not first. Okay? That was their big mistake. And we had that thing charted out, and they weren't obeying us. They weren't. Abdul is the head of the Taliban. Boom, boom. He had to do all these things. Some he didn't do. I said, nope, you're not doing. You got to do them all. This guy took. He immediately took all. He left the equipment behind. 13 soldiers dead. But he took everybody out. He took his soldiers out before a child would know. That's where Millie was so stupid. He was such a stupid guy. Millie. Okay? Those generals should have all been fired.

[01:27:35]
The Afghan. The people that were involved with Afghanistan should have all been fired. Then they'd be writing books about him, how stupid he was, how bad he was. But you take your soldiers out last. I had a big rally, and I saw a child in the front row about a year and a half ago. And I called the child up. I said, do you mind if I borrow your child? Oh, yes, please. And they came up kids, five years. I gave them quick details. You know, I said, we want to get out of this place, and we have this, and we have this, and we have the equipment. I gave them a little thing. I said, do you take your soldiers out first or last? After everything's done, you take them out last, sir. A child would know that we took our soldiers out first.

[01:28:19]
What was your plan?

[01:28:20]
And we left Bagroom.

[01:28:22]
Well, not only that, we have billions of dollars worth of equipment and military vehicles that they use for parades.

[01:28:28]
Now, the best equipment yet to embarrbutt us. The best equipment in the world.

[01:28:33]
The Taliban parade, where they've got tanks rolling down the streets and Blackhawks flying is the craziest thing I've ever seen. The fact that we left all that.

[01:28:40]
Stuff there, equipment in the world behind.

[01:28:43]
What would you have done differently?

[01:28:45]
Well, number one, we would have taken it out. Just so you go back a little bit further, I had a couple of conversations with Abdul, and from the time I had those conversations, because they were shooting our soldiers, you know, with the sniper stuff. They were shooting. They were shooting a lot of them. They were shooting a lot with Obama, much less with me, but they were shooting him. And I said, get this guy on the phone. The press went nuts when they heard this. This. I had a great conversation with him. It was a tough conversation. Eighteen months later, there wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at. And even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity, because he shouldn't admit it. His people went nuts. He said, yeah, well, I will admit no soldier. We didn't have a soldier killed in 18 months in Afghanistan, not one soldier was killed because he understood what was going to happen if that happened. I didn't have one soldier. Then when I left, after having gotten more votes than any sitting president in the history of the country and much more votes than I got in 2016, when I left, they started shooting our soldiers.

[01:29:50]
But more importantly, what they did is they did that whole thing with, you know, leaving. He shouldn't have left. Number one should have left from Bagram because Bagram is this mbuttive base. It's got tremendous acreage around it. Tremendous. It's a very big. It was built many years ago. And part of the reason you wouldn't have taken that is because it goes to China, one hour from where China makes its nuclear missiles. You should have never left Bagram. Number one. They should have left from Bagram. They should have left last. They should have gotten. You know, we have Americans that are still there. They should have taken all their equipment out. Everything should. Every plane, every screw should have been taken out every 10. And I said that. That's when I realized that Millie was a dummy. I said, we're leaving, but I want to get everything out. Sir, it's cheaper to leave it. I said, what do you mean it's.

[01:30:41]
Cheaper to leave it?

[01:30:42]
Yeah. He said, it's cheaper to leave it. That was cheaper. Cheaper. He said, it's cheaper, not more dangerous. He just said, cheaper. I said, I want every plane, I want every tank, I want the goggles. They have night goggles. They have all this stuff that these guys now have. He said, sir, it's cheaper to get out and leave it. I said, see, you think it's cheaper to leave $150 million brand new airplane in there than it is to fly it out with a tank of jet fuel and put it in Pakistan or just fly it directly back. It's cheaper to live. I said, this guy's nuts, I'm telling you. He was so stupid. He was so unwise. He was like an unwise man. And there were a number of them. But I defeated ISIS with the greatest generals. I had a guy who was so great, I flew to Iraq and I met the real generals, not these idiots that we deal with and we knocked out, you know, I defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. They said it would take five years. I did it in a matter of a few, literally a few weeks.

[01:31:47]
And we hit them hard. And he said, sir, we're going to hit them here, we're going to hit them there, we're going to hit them here, there's. And I said, this guy's great. I like this guy. I was told it would take five years. That's why I went, I said, how could it take five years? We have brand new fighters, we have the best planes, the best weapons, the best guns, the best bombs. How could it possibly take that long? And I flew to, I flew in left at 3 o'clock in the morning. Nobody knew I was going. I got on Air Force One and we started flying. And when we reached about half an hour away from Iraq, that was where the airport was, big airport about a half an hour away. They said, sir, I'm sorry, you'll have to turn off all your lights. Why? We're getting close to our site, our land. I said, you mean we spent $8 trillion that we can't leave the lights? Think of this, 20 years, $8 trillion that we can't leave the lights on in a plan. I said, that's okay, turn the lights on. I'm not going to fight them.

[01:32:46]
That's what this is.

[01:32:47]
Because it's too dangerous.

[01:32:48]
Yeah, too dangerous because they see the light up in, they'll shoot at it, you know. So I said, turn the lights off. Then they said, sir, we're going to also pull your shades if that's okay. I said, that's okay. The plane was pitch black. All the lights outside, you know, the blinking, they call them the blinking reds. They were all turned off. And I like to sit with pilots a lot of times. And these guys are specimens. I always say they're better looking than Tom Cruise. Okay? And they're even taller, like perfect specimens. These guys. Like, for a fighter, you know, you have some Guys that are perfect specimens and you know, they pick. They pick the best pilots in the Air Force, United States Air Force, to fly Air Force One. And I get up there and I'm sitting and I'm feeling my way up. You know, it's up high because 747, so you go through the stairs. But I sort of knew my way up. There wasn't a light in the plan. I'm saying, can you imagine? We spent trillions of dollars and we're trying to fly in blind. But I got into the plane, the cockpit is dark, black, little tiny light.

[01:33:52]
You could see the pilot, a perfect looking human being, his co pilot. Everybody was perfect. They were all like movie stars. You know, it's like I could have cast a movie with these guys and nobody would believe it because they were too good looking. So I said, how are we doing, Kevin? Sir, we'll be landing in 10 minutes. And I look outside, there's not a light. And I'm seeing I've landed a lot of planes. And you see like little lights. At least there's nothing. It's just pure desert. And I said, okay, Captain, good. But I'm looking now we're. You've been in many planes where it has the computer sign saying 1,000ft, 9 goes 1,900, 800. It's a computer voice, but it sounds like. But it's incredible. Voice 700. I say, Captain, are we okay? I'm looking. Are we okay, Captain? There's no lights and I'm looking. You know, normally when you land a plane, because I sit with Klaus a lot, I think it's great. I think it's a great profession, everything. It's incredible. They're incredible. These machines are incredible. He said, sir, we're fine, no problem, sir. I said, you know, I don't see any lights up there, Captain, sure, we're okay.

[01:35:01]
You know, so I mean, I'm exaggerating a little bit, you know, problem with exaggerating. It'll tell the story. They'll say, Trump was a coward. So I'm sitting with him, he goes, 500. And I'm telling you, there wasn't a light on the Runway. Nothing. And we're going in. You okay, Captain? Everything good? Yes, sir, no problem. We'll be down in about one minute, sir. And I'm telling you, Joe, you know, there's always a light. There's not a little pin. And all of a sudden and you hear, bwah, bwah. Perfect landing like glbutt. That's how good. I mean, These guys between the equipment and it's genius. It's pure. It was so dark, you couldn't see a thing. There was no Runway. You wouldn't know where the hell you are. You're in the middle of a desert. And then I got out of the plane. I said, thank you, Captain. That's a great job. And then I get out of the plane and I'm going down, and I see a general and another general and I see a staff sergeant, a drill sergeant and a various guy, all central casting, Central casting. They said, sir, would you like to rest?

[01:36:10]
I said, I don't want to rest. I wanted to figure out what the hell are we doing with isis. I'm hearing we can't. It's going to take years. No, sir, we can do it very quickly, sir. And anyway, we go into the room, we go and. I mean, Biden would have taken a nap for four days and then left without a meeting. So we go into the room and they have these guys. I say, how long can you do it? How long? We can do it in a couple of weeks, sir. I said, wait a minute. They told me five years, we can do it. And he gave me a number, like, just like in no time. I said, why haven't you done it? Because the orders came in from Washington, sir, and they would come here and tell us what to do. Don't you challenge us. We're not allowed to do that, sir. That's not the military way. They tell us what to do, and we have to respect them.

[01:36:56]
So do you think that it was incompetent, why they didn't go after isis?

[01:37:01]
I think it's a bad system. You know, when Mattis goes there or when Millie goes there, who's stupid? And they tell these guys that are actually smart what to do. And the guys that are smart are saying, we don't like what they're doing, but they're not allowed to sort of counteract. Plus, the guys that went there are arrogant. You know, they're arrogant fools. They're like stupid fools. The way they pulled out of. The way they. As an example, the way they pulled out of Afghanistan with the people falling off the planes all. It was worse than Vietnam with the helicopters falling. It was so bad, there was no reason for it anyway. So we knocked them out. And I mean, we have great military, we have great people, but not the television guys. And I rebuilt the military, and then they gave a chunk of it. Now you have to tell as much as it is. It's a tiny little Piece. Believe it or we have an unbelievable. I rebuilt the military, I rebuilt our nuclear. And in a way, I hated to redo it, but I got to realize how powerful that nuclear is.

[01:38:02]
Joe, one bomb, Israel was gone. But forget, one bomb could take out the entire East Coast. It's so bad. And I watch these poor fools talking about our oceans will rise one eighth of an inch over the next 500 years. I mean, we have people, we have countries. Right now, you have five countries. And don't underestimate North. North. If you take a look at North Korea, I was there. I mean, I was with Kim Jong. I had a great relation. I got along great with him. You know, the president, she got along great. That's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. It's a great thing. Obama thought we were going to go to war with North Korea. When I met with Obama, just prior to the takeover, you know, you meet, you have sort of a ceremonial meeting. But it lasted a long time, a lot longer than it was supposed to last. I said, what's the biggest problem? He said, north Korea. By the time I finished, I was. We had no problem with North Korea. We were really. It was a little tough at the beginning. Remember, he said, I have a red button on my desk.

[01:39:05]
I said, I have a red button also, but mine's bigger than yours and mine works.

[01:39:10]
I liked how you called them little rocket man.

[01:39:11]
I said. I said, yeah, little rocket. I said, little rocket man, you're gonna burn in hell. And it was a rough. Oh, so rough that people were worried. This is crazy. And then one day, I got a call, sort of like a fight. I got a call. You know, you ever see that pounding. And then all of a sudden. But I got a call, and it was from him, meaning his people. They wanted to meet. They wouldn't meet. Obama. He tried to meet. They wouldn't even talk to him about it. And I think he expected to go to war. I actually do. I believe he expected to go. And we checked their nuclear stockpile. It is substantial. I mean, it's. That's. I said, do you do anything? I got to know him very well. I got to know him better than anybody, anybody. And I said, do you ever do anything else? Why don't you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach. You have beautiful beach, nice beachfront property. You know, kiddingly, I said, you're always building nuclear. Just relax. You don't have to do it. Let's build some condos on your shoreline.

[01:40:08]
They actually have gorgeous stuff. And he said, I just have to do it because I need it for my safety, etc. I got to know him very well. We had no problem with him. If you have a smart problem, if you have a smart. Really, the right president, the smart president, you're not going to have a problem. And I say it to people. We have a bigger problem, in my opinion, with the enemy from within. And it drives them crazy when I use that term. But we have an enemy from within. We have people that are really bad people that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful. When you look at what's happening at our border, Joe, when you have people coming in that. When other countries are allowed to empty their prisons into our country with murderers, we had 13,099 murderers dropped in our country over the last three years and.

[01:40:59]
15,000 rapists, convicted rapists, drug dealers, drug lawyers. And that's just the ones that have been accounted for.

[01:41:07]
Correct. People from mental institutions.

[01:41:09]
What do you think? This.

[01:41:10]
Hundreds, Hundreds of thousands of major criminals, tougher and worse than anybody. We have these.

[01:41:18]
Well, we're seeing the consequences of it. In San Antonio, they've taken over apartment buildings. In Aurora, Colorado, they've taken over apartment buildings. These Venezuelan gangs, just the beginning. What do you think the strategy is? You know, one of the things that they've said is that you stopped a bill from being pbutted. But didn't that bill also include amnesty for the people that are already here?

[01:41:40]
Yeah, this is years after the fact. The damage was already done.

[01:41:45]
But what was the bill?

[01:41:46]
What was the problem? It allowed 2 million people and they were going to get amnesty. It was a horrible bill. It didn't protect us at all.

[01:41:54]
But we should just tell people what the strategy is. So one of the things, their strategy, one of the things that's been very clear here, is that they've moved a large percentage of these migrants that are coming across the border illegally. They've moved them to swing states. This is what's going on with Springfield, Ohio. Right.

[01:42:12]
They're in swing states. Well, that's not a swing state. I'm going to win Ohio by a lot. So that's not a swing, but it's called Springfield, Ohio, to be exact. And Springfield, Ohio is this very nice community of 52,000 people that just had 32,000 migrants that don't speak the language dropped into their community. You can't get into a hospital, you can't get into a school. It's gone from a beautiful little place to a horror show. And the mayor is a nice Guy. And the mayor says, we're looking for interpreters. I said, no, you've got to remove them and bring them back to their country. Mostly Haitians in this case. But they speak no. They speak no language. They speak no.

[01:42:57]
No Englishmen.

[01:42:58]
In fact, even the language they do speak, I mean, they can't get interpreters. They can't do anything. And the mayor's trying to be politically correct. They're all trying to be. In Aurora, Colorado, you have the worst, probably the worst gang, Ms. 13 might even be. You know, those two are the worst gangs. These are Venezuela gangs. They have taken over apartment complexes and they're going to want to take over the whole thing. And you have a weak governor, a pathetic governor who's a radical left democrat. He doesn't know what the hell to do. But you have it in many other communities. But they don't like to talk about it because it'syou know, it's bad for the community to talk about it. These people have been led in here by this imbecile. She's. And I mean it. She's a low IQ person. Low iq, right.

[01:43:44]
But it's also, it's obviously not just her. There's a strategy that's involved in letting these people.

[01:43:49]
Well, she was in charge of the border.

[01:43:51]
Well, she's in charge of the border. But they also, they utilize that app. The app that used to be used. It used to be used, I think, essentially, wasn't it for shipping? Wasn't it? When people were in this country, it.

[01:44:01]
Was used for shipping. And now it's used to deal with the cartels, the cartel, heads of the cartel, rich people. By the way, these are loaded. These people have so much money, they would call up. Think of this. They call up the app and the app tells them where they should take their load of illegal migrants from the Congo. You know, we have a lot from the Congo prisons in the Congo. I made a little bit of a sarcastic joke. A man named Dana White, who you love, who I love. I buttume you love him.

[01:44:33]
Love that dude.

[01:44:34]
I think he's in a clbutt by him.

[01:44:36]
He's probably the reason why you're here. I don't know, maybe he's one of the big ones.

[01:44:42]
He is the greatest guy. You know, I always say every. Nobody's indispensable. You know, everybody can be replaced. Maybe you can't be. You might not be. But Dana, what Truly, I don't think you know the things. He sold it for 4 billion. I said, what a herald. Who the hell is going to pay 4 billion, and they made, like, a great deal.

[01:45:02]
I mean, yeah, it's hard to learn that now.

[01:45:04]
Take him out. I think it's a whole different. No, he's the best, and he's also the greatest guy. He spoke at the whole thing with, you know, I had just been shot, and. And he got up and he spoke so better than anybody. I mean, who would be better to introduce you? I asked of all the people, and I know the biggest people in the world, and they all would have loved to have done it. I said, dana, would you do it? You know, it was interesting. He was away, and he said to the people that, you know, one of my guys called, said, I won't be able to do it. I'm. Gee, I just left with my wife and family. I won't, I said. He said, no. Yeah. I was a little surprised, even though I knew he was very far away, he was in some place, you know, and he deserved it with his family, you know, the whole thing. And then I said, all right, that's. And so we're looking who we're going to get, and all of a sudden, she comes in, sir. Dana White just said, he's going to do it, and he's coming back in tonight.

[01:45:54]
He's taking it. You know, the guy is just an incredible guy, and he's, like, a tough champion, but loyal. Yeah, he's got to be one of your favorite people. He's one of my favorite.

[01:46:04]
I love him to death. I've been friends with him for 23 years. I love him.

[01:46:08]
So would you have. Because what you're doing here is incredible. I mean, everybody tells me. All I know is today I'm going, you know, you're on Joe Rogan. People are telling me, like I said, I say, how the hell do you know that? But it's sort of what you've done here is amazing. Where would you be if you didn't do the UFC stuff? Would you have this show, do you think?

[01:46:28]
Yeah, I would still be doing it, for sure, yeah.

[01:46:30]
Would it be at the same level?

[01:46:32]
I don't know.

[01:46:33]
But you would have.

[01:46:34]
It's hard to know. I think, you know, one of the things that works for this show, I guess, is that I. I'm involved in so many different things, you know, standup comedy, ufc, and all the interests that I have that lead to the podcast.

[01:46:45]
Will you always want to do. First of all, you love ufc.

[01:46:49]
I love it. Yeah.

[01:46:49]
You love the fights. I mean, I watch you. You are loving it. They could Pay you nothing. It'd be very.

[01:46:54]
They didn't pay me anything for the first, like, 13 shows. I did it for free because they were hemorrhaging money. And I became friends with Dana and my. My position was, you're going to give me the best seat in the house. I get to sit cage side for the fights. I'll do it. And I wanted to help. I was like, I think these are the guys that we had always hoped for the early days of the sport. I started working for the company in 1997. I was the. Before the UFC was purchased by Zufa, which Dana worked for. So I was a part of the previous owners, and I only did it for a couple years. It was just too much, and I was losing money. And it was banned from cable because of Budweiser and John McCain, and you could only get it on DirecTV. And so.

[01:47:31]
And then I came along and I gave him the salary.

[01:47:34]
And he loves.

[01:47:34]
And he never forgot it.

[01:47:35]
He loves you for that. He talks all the time just to.

[01:47:38]
Interrupt you for once. So they couldn't get a sight because it was too dangerous and everybody was against it and they couldn't get license. And I gave him the first two or three sides, and they were great. And by the way, I went to the first fight, I said, I never saw anything like this. It was crazy. It was so good. Take the best fight you've ever. It was like that fight, right? It was so good that I gave it to him again. And all of a sudden it caught on. But, you know, when I wasn't in Vogue, you know, I've had time. You probably never had a time, but I had times when I wasn't exactly in vogue. Dana, they called him, he said, he's the greatest guy. There's nobody like him. He said, I'll never say anything bad about that guy. Because when I needed. Because they were having a hard time at the beginning, they almost pulled the plug a couple of times, right? He said he stood up and he gave us stuff that nobody else gave us and nobody wanted anything to do. Do. And he said, I will never.

[01:48:33]
And there was a time where it would have been very popular for him to say bad stuff about me. He said the greatest stuff about me. He said, you're going to try and get me to say bad stuff about Trump? I'm never doing it.

[01:48:44]
No. He's a very.

[01:48:45]
He's an unusual guy.

[01:48:46]
Very unusual guy.

[01:48:47]
He's a fantastic.

[01:48:48]
A perfect guy to be at the helm of something so controversial as the.

[01:48:51]
Ufc Less controversial now?

[01:48:54]
Well, now it's huge. Yeah. Well, this was always the thing that I would hope that it would be. I always knew that it was unbelievably entertaining, but I just didn't know if maybe I was crazy, maybe I loved it because I've had this long history of being involved in martial arts and maybe like other people who just think it's too violent.

[01:49:08]
But can boxing make it?

[01:49:10]
Yeah, boxing's still a great sport. I love boxing.

[01:49:13]
But it seems to be so unimportant now by comparison to ufc, don't you think?

[01:49:19]
I think. Well, you know, Dana is working with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They're going to start promoting boxing now. And with Dana at the helm of it, I think boxing can return. Because the thing is, they want to make fights that other people maybe, you know, promoters don't want to make because they want to protect their fighter. Controversial fights where, you know it's dangerous, like you don't know this guy could lose. And so the Saudis, they're smart. They just offer a tremendous amount of money and they're putting together fights that no one else can put together. They're doing that in boxing.

[01:49:48]
If Dana is involved, he'll probably make it good. You know the amazing thing though, the in fighting, no UFC fighter they say has ever died. And it looks to me much more violent than bucks. Many boxers have died. Isn't it interesting? And Dana tells me, because they take so many shots to the face.

[01:50:05]
Yes. And there's also no other options to preserve yourself, to protect yourself. So if you get hit in a UFC fight, you can clinch, you could try to take the fight to the ground.

[01:50:13]
You get options.

[01:50:13]
Also, you don't get allowed to get knocked down and then get back up. When you get knocked down, you're conc. And generally if a guy's really hurt, they could be finished on the ground and the fight's over. If it's boxing, you have 10 seconds to get up. You get up, your head kind of clears, but you're still in real bad trouble. And then you can kind of run away and survive until the bell rings. There are only three minute rounds and then you start again. So you're getting repeated punishment to the head. And then there's also the issue of guys weight cutting, which is a problem with the UFC as well. But weight cutting and boxing has led to. If you look at deaths in boxing, there's very few of them in the heavyweight division. Most of the deaths in boxing are the lighter weight divisions, because when guys Dehydrate themselves to lose weight, to make weight. Their brain is the last thing that gets rehydrated. Like it's very difficult to completely rehydrate your brain quickly. And you only have 24 hours between the weigh in and the fight. And it used to be the weigh ins were the day of the fight, like when Boom Boom Mancini had a fight with Duck Koo Kim and killed him in the ring, which is one of the last ones on television that we've seen.

[01:51:18]
That's right.

[01:51:19]
That was a crazy event for people and heartbreaking and it led to a bunch of different changes. And one of them is day before weigh ins to allow people to rehydrate better. And the other one is they dropped it from 15 rounds down to 12.

[01:51:30]
Which look, they should do that. You know, I'm not, I'm not the fighter, so. But those 15 round fights were unbelievable.

[01:51:37]
They were unbelievable. They were unbelievable. Yeah. You go back to the golden age.

[01:51:40]
Yeah. In terms of entertainment.

[01:51:42]
Oh yeah.

[01:51:43]
Those were the championship reps. Those were the greatest fights ever.

[01:51:47]
Those last three rounds were crazy. I mean, it's such a war of attrition. You know, a lot of people think even like a five round UFC fight, UFC is five minute rounds. It's so much energy you're burning out. And those last couple of rounds, those five round fights, the fourth and the fifth round, unbelievably brutal.

[01:52:03]
Who's the greatest UFC fighter in. Are you allowed to say, in your opinion? It's tough for you to say because you do this, but who do you think is the greatest of the fighters?

[01:52:12]
There's a lot of arguments for who's the greatest of all time. You know, Jon Jones, most people would say is the greatest of all time, never lost. It's. There's certainly a really good argument for that. There's another argument for Georges St. Pierre. I always leave in BJ Penn in his prime, Anderson Silva in his prime, you know, Mighty Mouse. People forget about Mighty Mouse because unfortunately he's a smaller guy. It's 125flyweight champion. He's one of the greatest expressions of mixed martial arts I've ever seen, I think to this day.

[01:52:42]
And Khabib, what about.

[01:52:44]
Khabib's fantastic, but if you looked at like accomplishments in terms of championship fights. Khabib retired 29. 0, but he didn't have his and.

[01:52:51]
Probably never lost a round.

[01:52:53]
They say he might have lost to Glace and T bow. He might have lost to him around. Might have lost a round and that was a controversial fight where people think that Glace and Tebow could have even got the decision in that fight. I'd have to go back and watch it again to make a decision.

[01:53:06]
But they're great athletes.

[01:53:08]
Oh, the best athletes in the world. And the most dangerous sport in terms of like it's. I always call it high level problem solving with dire physical consequences.

[01:53:19]
That's what fighting is, you know, I never forget. So there was a fighter named James Tony.

[01:53:24]
Oh, yeah. I love James Toney.

[01:53:25]
He fought as a very light fighter and he ended up as a heavyweight. This guy went through everything. He was almost. Almost like a lightweight.

[01:53:31]
He went from middleweight all the way up to heavyweight. Yeah. And beat Evander Holyfield as a heavyweight.

[01:53:36]
And he was a real fighter.

[01:53:37]
Oh, yeah.

[01:53:37]
So James Toney and I think it was St. George.

[01:53:42]
George St. Pierre.

[01:53:43]
St. Pierre. I think it was him. Who did he fight? James Toney?

[01:53:47]
No, James Tony didn't fight George St. Pierre.

[01:53:49]
He fought a UFC fighter.

[01:53:51]
Yeah. Randy Couture fought James Toney, was it. But that was like an easy fight. That was a very easy fight. Randy Couture just took him down and.

[01:53:57]
It was the most. And he's half the size and he just. Once he got to the ankles. In fact, the announcer said, it's over.

[01:54:04]
Yeah.

[01:54:04]
And he put him to.

[01:54:06]
Mounted him, strangled him.

[01:54:08]
He was. But he was talking big because he was much bigger. He was a pretty big guy.

[01:54:11]
James just wanted to make some money.

[01:54:13]
You think so? Yeah, but I never forgot it. It was. It was over very quickly. And he was lying, sleeping on the mat and he was talking, you know, he was doing the Muhammad Ali stuff, but it didn't work out. But I remember sold the fight. Yeah, that was Couture, probably.

[01:54:25]
Yeah, it was Couture. George never fought a boxer in an MMA fight. If he did, he would kill them.

[01:54:31]
Was he one of the greatest?

[01:54:32]
Yes, unquestionably. That's the argument. There's like a handful of guys you can make. The argument is the greatest of all time. People forget about Anderson Silva in his prime. He was unstoppable. But that's the thing is. And then there's Fedor Emelianenko, who fought in Pride in his prime. He was unstoppable. There's this.

[01:54:48]
And you have a couple now that are pretty good.

[01:54:49]
Oh, we've got so many now. Alex Pereira. There's an argument that he's the world right now. He's unbelievable. Believable. But it's like fighters can only compete at that level. For so many years. And so my opinion, you have to judge them at their very peak. You can't judge them when they're hanging on and still fighting. You can't judge them when they're coming up. You got to judge them in that championship peak. In that championship peak. There's a handful of guys that you would consider at the very top.

[01:55:16]
If they stopped a little bit sooner, some of them would have had. There are a couple that you just mentioned without mentioning names. If they stopped, they. They're perfect. They were unbelievable. And then at a certain age, they start getting knocked out, Right?

[01:55:30]
Yes, it's unfortunate. But the thing is, that same belief in themselves that lets them become a champion makes them think that they can do it long past the time that they actually can.

[01:55:38]
Well, Anderson Silver was essentially unbeatable, and then he lost a close one. Then all of a sudden, he had no.

[01:55:44]
He got knocked out. He got knocked out by Chris Weidman, right? He was kind of clowning in that fight, famously. And Chris Weidman had a vicious left hook, knocked him out. And then they fought a second time and he broke his leg on Chris Weidman, right?

[01:55:55]
That's right.

[01:55:56]
And after that fight, he was kind of never the same because that. That leg break injury which Conor McGregor had, there's quite a few fighters. Wideman actually wound up having the same injury, ironically, has only been like, you're.

[01:56:08]
Never the same because you can't kick.

[01:56:09]
Never the same. Well, you can. Weidman is still kicking with that leg. You can. But psychologically, when you throw a kick and your leg snaps in half and you're in agony for a year, Right. You have to get surgery. You have to get bolts and plates to keep your leg together. And then it takes forever for it to heal.

[01:56:25]
It always amazed me how the kicker, I mean, you have those cases, but the kicker will do tremendous damage to somebody's leg. But their leg doesn't seem to get damaged, isn't it?

[01:56:35]
It does get damaged. It hurts more than you.

[01:56:37]
Yeah.

[01:56:37]
But your shin, you. Your shin gets very numb after a while. And guys that are really good kickers, they're kicking the thigh and they. Kicking, the kicking, the kicking soft areas, and they're slamming this hard, numb shin, right? Their shin gets all these, like, micro fractures all over the shin, and it calcifies. Like, these guys can kick baseball bats. You ever seen break baseball bats with their shins. It's crazy. Some guys can do two baseball bats. Someone will hold the baseball bat and they just kick right through them.

[01:57:05]
But I watch your Enthusiasm now, right?

[01:57:07]
Yeah.

[01:57:08]
And it's like, that's why you're good at what? That's why nobody does this better that without the enthusiasm. Forget it.

[01:57:15]
Well, it has to be authentic like that. I mean, the only reason why I do MMA commentary is because I'm very interested in it. For real. I don't have to manufacture it. I'm very interested.

[01:57:25]
And you love going in there after the fight and they're sweating all over you, they're slopping all over you, they're bleeding sometimes. Does that bother you?

[01:57:33]
A little bit?

[01:57:34]
Yeah. Like two weeks ago with a guy I never saw, he. More stuff came out of his nose.

[01:57:41]
Yes, it was pretty nasty. But no, I'm very used to it. I just wanted him to be able to express himself.

[01:57:46]
You've done a great job.

[01:57:47]
Thank you.

[01:57:47]
You've done a great job.

[01:57:49]
So back to you. And back to what are you. And first of all, I love this idea of you teaming up with Robert Kennedy, and I love this Make America healthy again idea, because there are chemicals and ingredients in our food that are illegal in other countries. Countries because they've been shown to be toxic. There's pesticides and herbicides, and there's a lot of shoot that's been sprayed on our food that really is unnecessary, and there's a lot of health consequences that people are suffering from. A lot of these things. And look at this chart for you. Beautiful.

[01:58:23]
Because I had a feeling you'd be asking me. Look at this chart. These are healthier countries. Look where the United States is. I'm going to send this to RFK Junior.

[01:58:32]
Look at this is. Well, something along the. I was actually talking to RFK today, and he told me that more than 70% of young men are ineligible for the military because of their health.

[01:58:45]
I could see it.

[01:58:45]
That's crazy.

[01:58:46]
A lot of it's obesity.

[01:58:47]
So here's the life expectancy versus health expenditure.

[01:58:51]
Same chart.

[01:58:52]
Yeah. Did you see that usa.

[01:58:54]
That's pretty good.

[01:58:55]
Jamie's the best.

[01:58:56]
He's very good.

[01:58:57]
He's the best.

[01:58:58]
But. No, but look at that. Look at the usa.

[01:59:00]
Not good. And that's our food. That's our diet. That's. That's sedentary lifestyle. That's our diet. That's the chemicals we ingest. That's what that is.

[01:59:08]
But RFK is going to be very, you know, I think he's a great guy.

[01:59:12]
I love the fact that you guys teamed up.

[01:59:14]
Yeah.

[01:59:14]
And are you guys. Are you completely committed to have him a part of your administration?

[01:59:18]
Oh, I am. But the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environment because, you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil and gas. I think, you know, I think just keep him out of that to fire. So I'm going to sort of keep him out of a little. I said focus on health. You can do whatever you want, but I got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold, you know.

[01:59:37]
I understand. But listen, there's plenty of good work that could be done if you focus on health.

[01:59:42]
Here's the one that. Here's the one that. My all time favorite though.

[01:59:45]
What is that?

[01:59:45]
See the arrow right here? That's where I left.

[01:59:47]
Do you have anyone that is pressuring you to not work with him? Have there been people? RFK Jr Yes. Yes. I would imagine because financially he could put a dent.

[02:00:00]
I would say that. And you know, I think in many ways they've done a good job. In many ways they've done a bad job. But I would say that the big pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard that you don't have a relation. I've actually always gotten along very well with him. I've known him a long time time. He's a different kind of a guy. He's very smart, great guy and he's very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. You know, he thinks we spend a fortune on pesticides and all this stuff and then you end up. That chart is a terrible chart. The one previous. It's such a bad chart when you look at where we are compared to other countries that don't spend 10 cents. So, you know, and you save a lot of money. But yeah, we. I've had some people that aren't exactly thrilled. You can imagine. Right, sure. It's a good question actually.

[02:00:46]
Well, certainly if there are, it doesn't affect me. Some pharmaceutical drugs that have been prescribed that have negative consequences that these people have been profiting off of. And then you have a guy like RFK Jr. Who spends an enormous amount of time highlighting those things. You could say how they'd be very reluctant to have you support him.

[02:01:04]
I would say that's an understatement. Yes.

[02:01:07]
So what do you do to stop that from getting in the way?

[02:01:10]
Well, look, they've come up with some amazing things. I mean, I don't know how you feel. I know you're against the vaccine, certain vaccines, but like the polio vaccine. People had polio. There were. It was like a disaster. And they came up Dr. Salk and he came up with a vaccine and there's no polio now. Very interesting. There hasn't been polio, but now in the Gaza Strip. Can you believe that? Have you heard that there's been a big strain of polio coming out in the Gaza Strip?

[02:01:38]
Is it vaccine derived polio? Because, you know, there's a strain of polio that comes directly from the vaccine. Because unfortunately, sometimes you vaccinate people for polio.

[02:01:47]
I haven't heard of that.

[02:01:48]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:01:49]
I mean, all I can do is I sit down and I listen to him and I'll give it total. I would love him to be right because it's. If he's right, it's a lot less expensive.

[02:01:59]
Generally, there's two things that people point to when they point to the dangers of the far pharmaceutical drug industry. One thing is when pharmaceutical drugs were allowed to advertise on television. We're only one of two countries in the world that allow pharmaceutical drugs to advertise on tv. The other one's New Zealand, but they're more restrictive than we are. People are.

[02:02:20]
But those ads, those ads, when you hear like, you know, take a certain.

[02:02:23]
Drug and then you hear all the.

[02:02:25]
It causes cancer and baldness. We don't like baldness. Suicide and this and that and eyesight and you can lose your vision. And you know, I just, I actually asked one of these guys I would never take. I mean, the cost is things that are so bad they go through a whole list. I guess they save some liability, but man, I said, does that affect the purchase? And they say it really does. When they, when there's something you have and you read and then they go through the list of side effects, the potential side effects. It's not even the potential side effects. I mean, a lot of people are just. I asked that question. People hear that. When I hear it, I'm going to take a pbutt. That says, may affect your vision, may cause blindness, may this.

[02:03:06]
Yes. Well, I know you're aware of Callie and Casey means, right?

[02:03:09]
Yes.

[02:03:10]
Well, one of the things that they pointed out, and this is a very important thing for people to understand is what a lot of these drugs do is they act to somehow or another mitigate the effects of poor metabolic health. But most of these problems that these people are suffering from wouldn't exist if we put an emphasis on metabolic health. If people got healthier, they started eating nutritious food and taking vitamins, a whole host of these problems that people are having would go away. And the problem with that, from the Pharmaceutical drug standpoint is they wouldn't be able to sell drugs to these people. And this is a fear that.

[02:03:47]
And pesticides and things like that on the plants. And what do you think of that?

[02:03:51]
It's terrible. Well, I think regenerative agriculture, unfortunately is very difficult to scale to a point where you got a jack in the box on every corner, right?

[02:03:58]
That's right.

[02:03:59]
If everybody wants food, and we have food deserts and we have places like Los Angeles where no one's growing anything and everything has to be shipped in and it's very difficult to feed that many people. We've created this incredible society where we have these enormous cities, but it's very difficult to get food to these people. And then for a lot of these people in low income areas, the only food that's available is cheap, unhealthy food. And we could fix that. If we could send $175 billion to Ukraine, we could do something to fix a lot of the health problems that the United States has. And I think it would help us as a nation overall. Just if you just put it out there that, hey, as a nation we're going to make a concerted effort to get people healthier, just put it out there and people start making better choices.

[02:04:45]
Well, when you look at that chart, it's crazy. They just gave me that chart because they said, you may want to discuss this topic, which I know is a big topic for you. And when I looked at that chart and I looked at how unhealthy we are as a nation, that's a, That's a pretty big.

[02:04:58]
How are you so healthy? Is it golf?

[02:05:02]
No, it's genetics, I believe, you know, I'm a big.

[02:05:04]
Genetics is a big factor.

[02:05:05]
I really am. I mean, my father was.

[02:05:09]
Unfortunately, it is a big factor for health. Some people are just way more robust. But you do play golf a lot.

[02:05:15]
And that is both of my parents. It's. For me, it's good fresh air. It really is. It's fresh. You're outside. Even mentally, you're focused on that three footer. And for some, for a couple of hours you're not. And I go quick, I play fast, real fast, and I'm in, I'm out. But, you know, it gives me. I was never one that could like run on a treadmill. I just. And I can do it, you know, when pbutting a physical. They asked me to run on a treadmill and then they make it steeper and steeper and steeper. And the doctor said it was at Walter Reed. I said, it's unbelievable. I could have gone. I'm telling you, I felt I could have gone all day. But I said, doc, I can do this all day long. I'm not. I have no problem, but it's boring to me. Do you understand? It's just boring.

[02:05:58]
Golf's exciting.

[02:05:59]
But I did it for so long, they couldn't believe it that I did it. And I never did. You know, I don't do it. I don't really. You know, I have friends that run in this stuff all day long, but I had no problem doing it. But it's really boring. So with golf or something, you know, or tennis or whatever. Golf, as you get older, there's something really good about it, and you have.

[02:06:19]
Competition with competition, concentration.

[02:06:22]
And it's a great handicap sport.

[02:06:23]
And it's also a thing. I think that's. It cleans your mind, because when you're looking at a shot, that's all you can think of. When you're executing it gives you a couple of.

[02:06:32]
You know, it's interesting, like with tennis, if you're much better than somebody, you can't really play with somebody, you know, it doesn't work. You can give them sort of the equivalent of strokes, right? But it's not this. With golf. You can play with a lousy guy and give him a stroke. A hole or two strokes. A hole or something, you know, it's a good handicapping spot, but it gives me a little exercise. But I haven't played in a long time. I won a lot. I won 32 club championships.

[02:06:56]
Didn't you play right after you got shot?

[02:06:58]
No, where I. What I did is, I played with Bryson DeChambeau. Do you know Bryson? Yes, the pro, huh? He's a great player. And we played. It was a certain thing that we played, I guess, called breaking 50 or something. 50. We play from a certain tee, and if you can break 50. And it got tremendous ratings. Sort of like a crazy thing. It got. He's a great guy.

[02:07:22]
But wasn't that, like a couple of days after you got shot?

[02:07:24]
I don't know. I. I know. I.

[02:07:26]
That was one of the funniest things. You were on the golf course.

[02:07:28]
I think I did, yeah, maybe I did, but I, you know, I'd be very interestingly, I'm running for President of the United States. To me, it's such a big deal. It's so important. So I've got.

[02:07:41]
Now, what's the biggest deal in the free world?

[02:07:43]
It's 100 times bigger than the Super Bowl. And it's one person.

[02:07:47]
Yeah.

[02:07:47]
So you're down to two people. And we start off at 9 billion. Because you have 9 billion, they say in the world, who knows what that number is? But you get down to 350 million. Sadly, we have no idea what we have in this country, but let's buttume it's 325. 350, and you're down to two people. It's the biggest thing in the world. And when I heard she took off yesterday and she took off the day before, and she's going to take off tomorrow or the next day. I haven't taken a day off in 56 days. That's a long time. I haven't taken one day off. I don't. I didn't. I don't want to plug up. This is too exciting. Golf is great, but this is too exciting. This is more exciting than anything you can do.

[02:08:31]
And also, it's the home stretch.

[02:08:33]
It's the home stretch. Who would take a day off? So we have 11 days left now. And think of it. So I think I've gone 54, 55 days in a row, no days off. And I make speeches oftentimes, you know, sometimes not, but I make speeches. And when you make a speech, and my speeches last a long time because of the weave, you know, I mean, I weave stories into it. And if you don't, if you just read a teleprompter, nobody's going to be very exciting. You got to weave it out so you. But you always have to, as you say, you always have to get right back to what.

[02:09:04]
Yeah.

[02:09:04]
Otherwise it's no good. But the weave is very, very important. Very few weavers around, but it's a big strain on your. You know, it's a big. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. You got to be careful of the voice. You can lose that voice. The voice wasn't designed. I said today. So I made a big one last night. Night I was in Las Vegas, big one. The night before in Arizona, big one. I mean, they're all big. We have the. There's never been anything like it in terms of crowd. Never been close. Never been close. They say. He talks about crowd, says, you know what's very interesting? So we get crowds that are really big. And I say, you know, I've never had a story because I don't get good press. I don't think I've had a good story in years. I really don't. I don't. I swear I don't think you were talking about it a little bit, Oprah. Everybody loved me. I don't think I became President of the United States. I did great. The second time, I did much better. I don't want to get you in any disputes, but I won that second election so easy.

[02:10:10]
And not just because.

[02:10:11]
Let me get to that. I want to talk to you about that.

[02:10:13]
But here's the thing. I did that, and now I've gotten the nomination again. And don't forget to get these nominations. You go against very smart people. Ron DeSantis was hot. Got to go through him. Nikki Haley was hot. Had to go through her. I went through everybody. Record time. Record time. I got three nominations in a row. Won the first time, did much better the second time. You know, I get millions of votes, more the second time, and now I'm doing it a third time. And it's an incredible thing. I never get a good story. I only get bad preparation. Now, I will say this. It's a lot easier if you're a Democrat. If I were a Democrat.

[02:10:52]
You'd get a lot of positive press.

[02:10:54]
I would get a lot of positive press.

[02:10:55]
Yeah. No, it's a creepy, corrupt business. And the media, to a large extent, acts as a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party.

[02:11:02]
It's not even believable.

[02:11:03]
Yeah, I mean, it's bizarre to watch. And most young people, I think, are aware of it. I think most boomers still, unfortunately read the newspapers and believe in cnn.

[02:11:14]
But it's getting younger. It's getting for us, for a conservative. And you know, you know why I consider myself the Internet?

[02:11:22]
It's because the Internet's giving people information that they're not getting from anywhere else. And they like the very fine people hoax, the Russia Gate hoax. All these different things they've done, they tried to pin on you. That's like. It's a clear distortion of what you actually said.

[02:11:36]
Bloodbath hoax.

[02:11:37]
Yeah.

[02:11:38]
I was talking about the auto industry. It's a bloodbath because Japan and, of course, and China are taking our auto. And I said, it's a bloodbath. They said, ah, he used the word bloodbath.

[02:11:51]
It's going to be a bloodbath.

[02:11:53]
It's a terrible thing they do.

[02:11:54]
But that's the problem with propagandists because they take things out of context. And ultimately what they do is they diminish their own credibility because people don't want to listen to anymore because they see that they've done that and they recognize what's going on. And they feel insulted. Their intelligence.

[02:12:09]
Well, look at the ratings.

[02:12:10]
Yeah.

[02:12:11]
You know, shows like yours. So I have a son who's very smart and tall. Baron. Right. And he knows all about you. He knows about guys I never heard of. He said, dad, you don't know how big they are. They're big, you know. I said, who the hell is he? Like Ross. I did. He said, dad, he's a great guy. I mean, guys that are doing. It's a whole new world out there.

[02:12:34]
It's a different world.

[02:12:35]
And, you know, I'm on TikTok now.

[02:12:37]
Congratulations.

[02:12:38]
And I've done really well. No, but you know the crazy. Have you seen the numbers? Billions. Like billions of hits. It's crazy.

[02:12:45]
I'm sure TikTok's a wild application.

[02:12:47]
And I've gone up 30 points. A Republican is always down 30 with young people. I'm plus 30 and I'm on TikTok.

[02:12:57]
I think young.

[02:12:58]
It's had a huge impact.

[02:12:59]
Young people are rejecting a lot of this woke bullshoot. Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded. They're tired of these people that they think are mentally ill. Bill telling them what the moral standards of society should be today. And people are upset.

[02:13:12]
It's a big. There's a big difference now. But even in just a couple of years, I was shaking hands with people. They're young people.

[02:13:19]
The rebels are Republicans now. They're like, you want to be a rebel? You want to be punk rock? You want to like buck the system? You're a conservative now. That's how crazy. And then the liberals are now pro silencing criticism. They're pro censorship online. They're talking about regulating free speech and now regulating the First Amendment. It's bananas to watch, Joe.

[02:13:44]
They come after their political opponent. Well, I got more guys. I always say, you know, I kid, but I'm not kidding. I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the meanest of them all. He'd kill you in two seconds if he didn't like you. Right. I've been under investigation more than Alphonse Capacity only because it's political opponent stuff. And I've won. I won the big case in Florida. I'm winning. The other stuff, you win. But you know what they did? They did something that's only done in third world countries. They came after their political opponent. Yes, I could have put crooked Hillary in jail.

[02:14:18]
Well, not only that, but then weaponizing it by saying that that's what you're going to do once you get in office, isn't it? By ignoring what they're doing right now. It's crazy.

[02:14:27]
I heard it that somebody was defending me today. No, that's. They say, that's what you're doing to him. They're going, he's going to put us in jail. He's going to invest.

[02:14:37]
That's what you're doing.

[02:14:38]
That's what you're doing to him.

[02:14:39]
Yeah.

[02:14:39]
A lot of people say, will you do that? Will you do that to him? To them? If you win, you know, it's. The presidency has tremendous power. I could have put crooked Hillary.

[02:14:49]
I respected that. You didn't, because what you said was it would be bad for the country.

[02:14:53]
No, I can't. I couldn't even imagine. Imagine you have, first of all, Secretary of State, but more importantly, the wife of the President of the United States of America going into jail. And if you ever saw. When I'd say something about her, they'd all say, I didn't say it. I never said it. They say, lock her up, lock her. And I'd always go, take it easy, Just relax. We're going to win this thing. Take it easy, take it easy. And I'm telling you, I kept it down. Just the opposite. Now they say, oh, Trump wanted to put her in jail. No, I saved her from going to jail. They had more stuff on her. And Comey had it, because when Comey got up and he stupidly. Because he's a stupid guy, too, he goes, he's a stupid son of a thing. He got up, Joe. He got up. And instead of saying, she's innocent of all charges, he went over each charge and each charge was a killer. And he go, and as far as her doing this, she's innocent. And this. And then she's only an unfair prosecutor would go, but every time you heard these charges, they sounded so bad.

[02:15:56]
They were bad. And all it was is he wanted more airtime. If he would have gone up and said, I've thoroughly investigated Hillary Clinton and she's done nothing that we feel is wrong, it would have ended. Instead, he wanted to be up there because he's a pr. He's a hog. And he starts going through. And you know what he had? They had a huge problem because FBI is great. The people there, not the top people, the people, the real people, the people that work there. It's like the real generals that I told you about that defeated ISIS in record time. The FBI guys are great. I'll bet you I'd be at 95% in the FBI.

[02:16:37]
I bet that's right underneath.

[02:16:39]
And so here's the thing. So he goes with his. And instead of just saying, he goes through each charge, right? And I would say, man, those are bad charges.

[02:16:49]
Sounds terrible. Because this is before I. With those charges.

[02:16:52]
Don't forget, this is before I got there. Right now, he was trying to protect her, but he did her a great.

[02:16:56]
Disservice because he wanted attention.

[02:16:59]
He was stupid.

[02:16:59]
So I want to. I want to talk about 2020 because you said over and over again that you were robbed in 2020.

[02:17:05]
Yeah, totally.

[02:17:06]
What. How do you think you were robbed? Everybody always cuts you off. I'm going to allow.

[02:17:10]
Well, they not only cut you off. Well, what I'd rather do is we'll do it another time. And I would bring in papers that you would not believe. So many different papers. That election was so crooked. It was the most crooked election.

[02:17:24]
Okay, but give me some examples of how.

[02:17:26]
Well, let's start. Let's start at the top and the easy ones.

[02:17:29]
Okay?

[02:17:29]
They were supposed to get legislative approval to do the things they did and they didn't get it. In many cases, they didn't get it.

[02:17:36]
What things?

[02:17:38]
Anything. Like for extensions of the voting, for voting earlier, for this. All different things. By law, they had to get legislative approvals. You don't have to go any further than that. If you take a look at Wisconsin, they virtually admitted that the election was rigged, robbed and stolen. They wouldn't give access in certain areas to the ballots because the ballots weren't signed. They weren't originals. They were. We could go into this stuff. We could go into the ballots or we could go into the overall. I'll give you another.

[02:18:14]
Are you going to present ever? Like, what do you. Do you think, like, Let me just give you.

[02:18:21]
Before 51 intelligence agents come up, that the laptop was from Russia. It turned out to be totally false.

[02:18:32]
51 former intelligence agents, Right.

[02:18:34]
They say that made. I don't believe it's this much, but it doesn't matter. I won by, like, I lost by, like. I didn't lose, but they say I lost, Joe. They say I lost by 22,000 votes. That's like 1/10 of 1% less than that. It's a tiny little thing, 22,000 votes spread over that. Spread over this period. So 51 intelligence agents lied. They lied. They lied. They knew it was. It was Hunters. It was from his bed. It was Hunter's laptop. They said it was created by Russia. Russia. Russia. It was the Russia hoax. The Russia hoax. Was a big hoax. It was all a big hoax, so.

[02:19:16]
Well, that's clear. That's one example. That is a good example.

[02:19:18]
That's a big example. They say it made a 17 point difference. That's a big example. But that's only one. And you can go into the ballots where they wouldn't give you access to the ballots. You could go into the ballot harvesting, you could go into $500 million for the lockboxes.

[02:19:36]
But just in terms of narrative. So there's two things, right? There's the Russia hoax, there's the collusion with Russia. That was never proven, right? That's one.

[02:19:43]
No, it's proven it didn't happen.

[02:19:45]
Right, Right. But they talked about it on.

[02:19:48]
But it took two and a half years to.

[02:19:50]
But not only that, but it was a constant narrative on television. That's a constant narrative that gets into people's minds, especially low information people that just watch the news that you're in collusion with Russia. So that's one. So that changes the narrative. And then you have the 51 former intelligence agents that work with the original Twitter and get them to remove links. You can't share it on dms. You cannot share that story. They swept that story because they said it was Russian disinformation, even even though they knew it was not 100%. So that's two examples that are real examples. Now, anyone who considers himself a legitimate, objective observer of American politics, if you really want the best person to win, you would want people to not lie. And the only reason why they got away with this lie was because they continually labeled you as this horrible threat to democracy and his. They kept saying you were going to be a dictator, ignoring the fact that you weren't a dictator for the four years where you were actually the president.

[02:20:50]
I was actually the opposite of a dictator. I was a very straight guy. But look, those three things, you take those three things, each one of them by themselves causes the result to be different.

[02:21:00]
It does.

[02:21:00]
And then you can go into 100 other things. There are so many. We can't have corrupt elections and we can't have open borders. We need a. We need. You need to have a country. Country. You need borders. You need fair elections. And I'll tell you the other thing you need is you need a free and fair press. One of the things I like about doing a show like this. Can you imagine Kamala doing this show?

[02:21:22]
I could imagine her doing this show.

[02:21:24]
She'll be laying on the floor, she.

[02:21:26]
Was supposed to do it, and she might still do it. And I hope she does.

[02:21:29]
She's not gonna.

[02:21:30]
I will talk to her like a human being. I will try to have her.

[02:21:32]
If you did this kind of an interview with you, I hope she does because it would be amazing mess. She'd be laying on the floor comatose. You'd be saying, call in the medics.

[02:21:41]
I think we'd have a fine conversation. I think I'd be able to talk to her. I wouldn't try to interview her. I just try to have a conversation with her and hopefully get to know her as a human being. That was my goal, having her on, trying to get her to express herself just as a. I don't know if these. I don't think these formats are good. I don't think that two people. First of all, I hate the idea of the presidential debates because I hate the idea of a time limitation on complex ideas. Ideas also, you have to break.

[02:22:06]
I think you have to have the debates too.

[02:22:08]
Right. But the way they do the debates, I think, is the wrong way to do it. I think they should have a conversation. I think you and Kamala, you sit across a table with no one in the room but the two of you. Of course, you're not going to shout each other. Of course you're not going to.

[02:22:22]
I mean, it may get. They used to do it.

[02:22:25]
Wouldn't. But that would be the way to do it.

[02:22:27]
They used to do it that way.

[02:22:28]
Put cameras on you with no. No one interfering with press, with checking whether or not it's factual, especially when it's biased because they checked you all those times and they didn't check her with clearly things that were inaccurate. Right. So have two people just have a conversation with us without a time constraint. And also this idea, they cut off the microphone.

[02:22:51]
No crowd.

[02:22:52]
No crowd. Crazy, too, because you're good at working a crowd.

[02:22:54]
I would rather have a crowd.

[02:22:55]
Of course you're good at crowds.

[02:22:57]
But I had no. So they gave me an alternative. I don't think he wanted to debate.

[02:23:01]
Why did they want no crowd? What was the argument?

[02:23:03]
I think they thought I wasn't going to accept it. So I believe what they wanted to do is have me not accept. So they gave me a deal I couldn't refuse. And I said, I'll do it. Okay. It's like the mob, right? I'll take it. So they came to me, they said, we'll debate Joe Biden. You know, that thing got tremendous ratings, too. That was crazy. Crazy. But we'll debate Joe Biden. But you can't have a crowd. They also wanted sitting down. I said, that's the only thing. I said, look, you got to stand up. You can't really sit down. You know, in the old days, they did sit down a little bit, but he gets tired. You got to stand up. And they agreed to it. It was a very tough thing. It almost killed it. They wanted to. They wanted to have, like, desks. We said. I said, I think we should stand up. And that was the only thing I asked for. I. I said, we got to stand up. I thought it looked bad for, like, the public, but they said, no crowd, and cut off the mic. And I said, I can live with it.

[02:24:00]
I mean, I can live with it. And they thought I was going to reject it. And then they would say he didn't want to debate Sleepy Joe.

[02:24:06]
Right.

[02:24:06]
That's what they thought was going to happen.

[02:24:07]
Well, they tried to say that with you and Kamala as well. They tried to say that you didn't want to debate her as well.

[02:24:11]
No. By the way, with her, number one, I'm leading. Number two, you know, I didn't. They also said it with the primary. So I had, like, 10, 12 guys, right? In the primary. No, stupid guys. I mean, they're governors in their Senate. They're not stupid people. Some are stupid, but not all of them. And all my guys said, you have to be in the debate. I said, why? I'm leading by 74 points. The closest guy to me, I'm like 60 points, 70 points higher. Why would I stand there like an idiot for two hours and let every one of them scream at me? I'm going to be the focus, right? And I said, I'm not debating. And it was a very smart thing because, you know, it was. They just killed themselves.

[02:24:52]
The Republican primaries.

[02:24:53]
Yeah, the Republican primaries with. I like debating. I think you have to debate, but I like debating.

[02:25:01]
It has to be fair.

[02:25:01]
I like debating. Like the Rosie O'Donnell debate. I like debating. When you have a credit. Remember the Rosie O'Donnell crazy thing, Megan, that was a hell of a question, man. If I didn't come up with that answer, it was a great line. Well, what it was is, you know, that was. We had 28,000 people. That was the Cleveland arena where the Cavaliers played.

[02:25:20]
Right.

[02:25:21]
LeBron James. Not a big fan of LeBron James, but he is a good basketball player. But, you know, that was the. And when I said that, the place went crazy. And she kept talking. No, she had, like, 10 other.

[02:25:33]
Yeah, well, Megan said, you said it to other people. And you admitted you did. But it was funny. It was a comedic timing moment.

[02:25:39]
It was fun.

[02:25:40]
That's what they wanted.

[02:25:41]
It was lucky I did it because she was drowning. Oh, she wasn't finished that question, but she kept talking, but you couldn't hear. To this day, they don't know what she said, but it wasn't buzzing. So anyway. But we had a good time.

[02:25:53]
It's comedic timing, and that's the reason why to have a debate in front of a large audience. And then they probably do with the Al Smith dinner.

[02:25:59]
I got very good reviews on that.

[02:26:00]
That was great. Very funny. Some very funny stuff. The Tim Wall stuff was very funny. Tim Wall, Yeah, it's funny.

[02:26:06]
That's a real beat.

[02:26:07]
That's a crazy one. She. She said that she had picked him. And this. One of the questions I want to ask her was when she was sleep deprived. She said she was suffering from sleep deprivation when she picked him. Which is just.

[02:26:18]
I was, hey, maybe take a nap. So I was, okay, look, let's see how it all turns out. I think we're going to win. I think we're way ahead now. I think we're way ahead. But can I bring you back to 2020? I think they're going to look at two things. They're going to say they should have had a primary, even if it was a short primary, they shouldn't have picked her. And then she's going to say, I shouldn't have picked this guy.

[02:26:38]
She shouldn't have picked that guy.

[02:26:39]
That guy.

[02:26:40]
The lying about Tiananmen Square, everything. Admitted that. Yeah. The military record, buttistant coach versus head coach, little things.

[02:26:48]
So I did McDonald's last week.

[02:26:50]
I saw that.

[02:26:51]
And I actually got a call from your friends at Google, from Sundar. That's pretty good, right? He said, this is the biggest thing we've had in years.

[02:26:59]
You at McDonald's.

[02:27:00]
At McDonald's. Did you know that? It was one of the.

[02:27:02]
It was funny.

[02:27:04]
Who's a great guy, by the way? But he said, this McDonald's thing, I want to tell you, it's one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google. It just hit. But the reason I did it and I actually, you know, you never know about this stuff. I thought it was a throwaway. I didn't think our conversation's a throwaway, but I thought that was. I thought I'd walk in and that was only to highlight the fact. And I have a friend, he owns like 56 of these McDonald's. And he said, do you want to use one. I said, yeah, I love it. So we went there and the crowd was crazy. You know, they had 28,000 people, people around the whole thing. Did you see the outside? It was crazy. The cars couldn't get through. Secret Service was not exactly thrilled. We had no idea what the hell. But I went into the place and I did the french fry thing and it just hit. But that's like in life sometimes you do. I thought it was like a quick throwaway. We're going to be there for 15 minutes. Then I said, I worked here for 15 minutes, which is 15 minutes more than she worked here.

[02:27:58]
She lied about McDonald's and, you know.

[02:28:01]
Is that proven that she never worked?

[02:28:04]
Well, McDonald's has no information. No, she has no information. There's nobody. The manager said she never worked there. You know, it was a certain place. And he said they never. No, she lied. She's a liar. You know what they do? They'll say, like on any one of the questions, take any. They'll say it's the exact opposite of what I say. Ivf, he's against ivf, the fertilization.

[02:28:28]
Right.

[02:28:28]
He's. And it's the exact opposite. I was. I came out immediately strongly in favor. And they do ads. I'm against it. It's wrong on every single topic. And, you know, she changed policies on 15. I've never seen a guy change. Anybody change on more than one. You know, you can maybe get away with one. Her whole life fracking every single thing that she was for the confiscation of guns she wants to confiscate. Now she's saying everybody should have gun. In fact, we're going to get her a magic. I'm going to send her a MAGA cap. But she's changed. And I don't think people are buying it. I don't think people are buying it.

[02:29:06]
Well, some people are buying it because they want to buy it because it's blue. No matter who. There's. There's a certain percentage of our population that's going to vote Democrat no matter what.

[02:29:13]
That's true.

[02:29:14]
They're pressured. There's their community, their ideology. It's, you know, left is good, right is evil.

[02:29:20]
I don't understand why, okay, you have a wall or you have a. You know, I built 570 miles of wall. Everyone said I built a lot of wall. Exactly the stuff. But you have a border. What I don't understand is who would want people to come into our country from places unknown? Like, sometimes they'll say, About a fighter from parts unknown. Right. Remember Haystacks, Caleb? From parts. From parts. Under the oldest. Those are the old days. That's even before you. But who would want people to come in, pouring into our country? We don't know anything about it.

[02:29:58]
But that's. I want to ask you this. Why do you think they're doing that?

[02:30:00]
I think because.

[02:30:01]
Do you think they're trying to buy votes? Do you think they just want cheap labor? Like, what is. What's the idea?

[02:30:07]
There's a couple of theories. They hate our country. They're stupid, or they want to buy votes. It's one of those three things. Yeah, they want it now. They are trying to get people registered who, you know, don't even know what the country is.

[02:30:18]
And they're trying to give people amnesty. People that live here. They're trying to give them citizens.

[02:30:21]
They want to give them citizenship or they want to. Well, how about what happened?

[02:30:25]
Think about the amount of money that they've given them when they've come here. The food stamps, the benefits that even our poor people aren't getting.

[02:30:31]
$200 billion. And that's a way low number. That's a way low. You know, it's interesting. New York has always been like, you know, sort of like always looking for money. They've spent $100 billion on this stuff. I don't know where they. And they're not getting the money from the federal government. And it's crazy. And because the mayor came out and said, we can't live like this, they investigated him. He gets. I, by the way, I called it. I said, he just got himself indicted. This group is stupid, but they're vicious. They're stupid people, but they're vicious people.

[02:31:06]
The 2020 elections, you say you have all this evidence that it was rigged. Why haven't you put this evidence. Evidence in a consumable form. And what.

[02:31:16]
Oh, I did. I have books on it. And by the way, books have been written on it. We have an author named Hemingway, who is a great writer. She wrote a book on it. But many books have been written on it. There are books that are. What's happened is judges don't want to touch it. They would say you don't have standing. They didn't rule on the merits. They. The merits never got there. The judges didn't have what it took to turn over.

[02:31:48]
Let's talk about the potential vulnerabilities for elections and election fraud. One of them is mail in ballots. The other one is the. If someone can break into voting machines, if someone can hack voting machines, those are two huge ones.

[02:32:03]
Elon Musk, what can be done? Elon Musk, I think he said it public. I hope he did because I wouldn't want to be the one. But he's a really smart guy and he's a very good guy with computers. Right. You'd say he's, he's one of the smartest people alive. Anybody that can land that 20 story building and perfect.

[02:32:21]
And while he's doing Starlink, while he's talking to me about Twitter and then he agrees to StarLink and tweets 100 times a day.

[02:32:28]
He's an amazing guy.

[02:32:30]
Yeah.

[02:32:31]
He said to me that unless you have paper ballots, it can never be an honest election. That's a big statement.

[02:32:37]
It's a big statement.

[02:32:38]
We should go to paper ballots. You know, France did, they went the mail in voting and it was all messed up. You know the amazing thing with the machines? So we have the machines, they cost 10 times more. A paper ballot would cost 8%. And they make paper ballots, they're all watermarked and everything else. They're very sophisticated. But if you take a look, look, paper ballots, 8% the cost and you're done by 9 o'clock in the evening. Right now we have these sophisticated machine, it goes up to heaven, it goes all over the place and down and around. And they say we'll need two weeks to figure out who the hell won the election.

[02:33:14]
Do you think that's by design?

[02:33:15]
Yeah, I do. I think it's very crooked. That's my opinion.

[02:33:19]
You're allowed to have that opinion. Let's say you win in November. What can be done to mitigate these problems? What could be done at a, you know, at the level that the President has power?

[02:33:31]
Well, if I win, that'll Bethis will be my last election. But I think I owe it to the country. Yeah, yeah, but I think I owe it to the country. We have to have fair elections.

[02:33:41]
So how can you fix that?

[02:33:42]
You know, Jimmy Carter was in charge of a commission, you know, that many years ago and they put him and Scoop Jackson and various senators, you know, distinguished people that were retired and they came up with a report and the report's primary finding was you cannot have mail in ballots. Because if it's a mail in ballot, you know, I went to the voting booth the last time, whatever it was, and I walked in in Palm beach and I walk in and they know me, they say, Mr. President, could I see your identification? Yes. Boom. Here's this, here's that everything. And then you sit and they watch you sign and you really. There's not a lot you can do. I mean, if you wanted to be dishonest, it's sort of beautiful, right? If instead of that, I'm going to send them a ballot.

[02:34:28]
Right.

[02:34:29]
It has to go through the postal services. It has to go through a lot of people. They mail you houses that, you know, the house was demolished and the people have left and it's so bad. The one thing with Jimmy Carter, he had a very strong commission. No mail in ballots. And we're the only one that does elections this way anymore. They've gotten away from it.

[02:34:51]
And this is a. It ticked up in a big way after Covid. It used to be like soldiers serving.

[02:34:55]
Overseas, they used Covid to cheat.

[02:34:57]
Yeah, well, they used Covid to certainly push this mail in ballot. Another thing.

[02:35:02]
But they use Covid to cheat.

[02:35:04]
But here's another.

[02:35:04]
And the last election was a little bit of a. You couldn't even get security guys, big strong guys to watch. You know what you'd call them? They'd call them and they'd say they were afraid to go out. You know, we were in the middle of COVID We were in the middle of COVID Right smack in the middle. And they didn't want to die. You know, they didn't want to catch it. It was like, in a way, it was. It was like a ghost town and the whole thing. But mail in ballots are a bad thing.

[02:35:33]
Bad thing. That certainly is a problem. Mail in ballots are a problem.

[02:35:37]
But every other country, you know, other country, a voter id.

[02:35:40]
Voter ID is the most bizarre argument that I've never seen anybody articulate in a way that's convincing because you don't need voter. Well, it doesn't make sense any other way. I've tried to straw man it or I tried to steel man it, rather. I've tried to like, look at it from a position like, why would you not want people to have id? And a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous. ID to get a driver's license.

[02:36:04]
Okay, but here's now the next step. Gavin Newscom, one of the worst governors in the world. And I used to, frankly, I used to get along, but I don't get along with him because he's just too, you know, it's just a whole con job. But Gavin Newscom the other day signed a bill that you are not allowed to ask a person, even ask them whether or not they have a voter id.

[02:36:26]
Now, what could be a charitable reason why any.

[02:36:28]
Because they want to cheat.

[02:36:29]
But that would be the only thing that makes sense that's taken it to.

[02:36:32]
The next level, right now, you know, you have id. The Democrat National Convention, when they had it the last time I saw, they had a sign like a billboard on the name of the person, where they live, how they live, who the hell their boyfriends are. Every single. And a big picture. That's for their. They have an idea, a big idea. It was hanging like you were a prisoner. They had these mbuttive cards, everything. And yet, when it comes to the vote, in theory, the most important thing we do, okay, when you go to a grocery store, you give id, but for a vote, it's supposed to be a sacred thing, and it should be a sacred thing. No voter id, because they want to cheat.

[02:37:14]
Well, it doesn't make sense in any other way. I've tried to look at it. There's no other way. There's no argument that anybody's presented that makes any sense. Why?

[02:37:23]
You know the funny thing, Joe, The Democrats, the people, they all think you should have it. In other words, you should have. Yeah, if you go to the people, Mrs. Schwartz, Mrs. Smith, Mr. Mrs. Jones, sure. They say, of course, yeah, Democrats, they say, yes. It's the politicians that don't want it, like Schumer and these guys, they don't want it because they want to be able to cheat. Because you know what if they didn't have it? Okay, who is going to vote for somebody that wants open border? Who's going to vote for somebody that wants to have men playing in women's sports? You know, I have never had one person come up to me and say, president, you got to do something to allow men to play in women's sports. Have you ever. Just like I've never been called by a pollster. I told you my little theory on pollsters, okay, I'm getting myself in trouble with some of these things, but I don't really care. Nobody's ever come up to me and say, said, we want to have men playing women's sports. And you know, I had a funny thing at a property I own in California.

[02:38:25]
I have a woman who's a very good athlete and she works there as a manager. And Brian Urlacher, the big Chicago Bears great player, you know, 10 time also, I guess hall of Famer, great guy, big strong guy. And she said, oh, he one of my favorite athletes. Can I have a picture? And I took a picture and I sent her. And I noticed she was the size of his leg, his Leg was bigger than she was. And I put it out. Should men play in women's sport? The whole. It was just so ridiculous.

[02:38:55]
What's one of the most bizarre and polarizing ideas that's promoted by the left?

[02:38:59]
But who wants it now? Unless you're going to cheat in elections, you're never going to get. Nobody wants it, right? I don't think anybody wants it. I've never. I've been told everything, you know, you can. Some people want this. I don't know of anybody that wants open borders. Nobody's ever come up to me and say, president, you gotta let the world come into our country right now. If they won. So they have 21 million. I think it's much higher than that because you have got aways, you know, gotaways where they just walk in. They walk in and the other thing you have is human traffickers. You have traffickers and they traffic in women. And they're going wild now. We used to. You know where you have to look? The trunk of cars. Can you believe it? They put women in trunks. They'll put three women in a trunk. These people are savages. They're horrible. The worst people, the human. And they're making the kind of money they make on drugs, they're almost making on trafficking now. And the thing that's made it hot is the Internet. That's what, you know, you think of it almost as an ancient thing, but it's the Internet.

[02:39:56]
But who would want to have these things? Who would want to have. There's so many. The transgender operations where they're allowed to take your child when he goes to school and turn him into a male to a female. Mail without parental consent. Who wants this? Does anybody want this? I've never heard of anyone. And I can go into 10 different things. The only way they get them is by no voter id. You can't have voter id. They don't want any. They want to cheat. There's only one reason. Because the voter ID is so basic. It's the most basic thing.

[02:40:30]
It's very basic.

[02:40:32]
Who would want this? They want it so they can check. Because their policies are no good. I'll tell you, they're very smart when it comes to that. They're very smart, although they're not smart in terms of politics, in a way. Because what do they have that people want they really don't have? They give away a lot of health care, a lot of stuff. But for the most part, their policies are terrible. Their policy on military. She's running on a Tax hike. She's going to raise your taxes. You got to hear this. We are going to raise your taxes. And the people clap. But who is going to win with her? All my life I grew up with politicians, lower taxes. She's politicking that we are going to raise your taxes.

[02:41:15]
Well, they want to raise. The idea is you want to raise the taxes to the highest earners. I know, but millionaires and billionaires are not paying their fair share.

[02:41:22]
But it doesn't work that way.

[02:41:23]
Well, it's a narrative, right? And it's a narrative that appeals to people that are not doing well and they're like, yeah, our problems are that these rich people are not paying taxes.

[02:41:31]
Well, the problems are the rich people are going to leave and they're going to close up their companies and then the other people aren't going to have jobs. You know, that's what happens.

[02:41:38]
It does happen in other countries.

[02:41:39]
But the whole. Because you brought it up. I'll tell you what, we just. He's doing a very good job in Virginia. Glenn Youngkin. I don't know if you like him. Not like him.

[02:41:48]
I don't know him.

[02:41:49]
But they. Oh, you don't? The governor of Virginia. So we have a case where they found thousands of illegal ballots. A judge just ruled that they have to be able to vote. Just happened today. Just before I walked in here, I heard a judge just ruled that you have to keep those people in. They're illegal. They're illegal votes now. I think they'll be overturned at the next court. One thing I found, because I had a couple of things that they get overturned a little bit. You know, the system. Because the system, you have to hope that the appellate judges, honest. Otherwise we don't have a country anymore. It's very important. But the whole thing with illegal ballots, it's got to be looked at. You got to have. You have to have voter ID and you have to have additional id. You have to have an ID that shows that you're a citizen of the country.

[02:42:38]
I agree.

[02:42:39]
They don't want that either.

[02:42:40]
I agree. One of the things that I want to talk to you about is the JFK files. And one of the things that you said was that if they showed you what they showed me, this is your court, you wouldn't want people to know it either.

[02:42:55]
So I opened them up partially. I was met with from good people. I mean, look, I mean, good people, people that were, well meaning. Mike Pompeo was one of them. He's a good person. They called me. They Said, sir, would rather have you not. Afterand I did open them, but I was asked by some people not to open them. There's a Martin Luther King file too, by the way, that they'd like to see. I don't know if you know, but there is that, but JFK in particular. So they called me, a lot of good people called me, people that I, you know, that you would find reasonable people. And they asked me not to do it. So I said, well, we'll close it for another time, but if I win, I'm going to open them up. I'm just going to open enough.

[02:43:45]
Why didn't you open it up the first time? Because a lot of times the hesitation.

[02:43:49]
Addresses people that are still living. There are people that are affected and there could be some national security reason that for, you know, that I don't have to necessarily know about. But some very good, talented people asked me not to do it. I opened it up and then they said, would it be possible for us to do that a different day?

[02:44:09]
How much of it did you read into?

[02:44:15]
I think it's going to be just fine to open it. Let me put it that way. I think it's fine. It's going to be time. It's a cleansing, you know, it's really a cleansing. So I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it immediately, almost immediately upon entering office.

[02:44:27]
Well, the thing when people look at it from the outside and you sort of imagine what could be a reason why they would not release those files, it would be there's people that were implicated for the buttbuttination.

[02:44:41]
Well, when there are living people, you generally tend not to want to do it when people are still living, living.

[02:44:48]
People that formerly work for the government.

[02:44:50]
For the government and living people that were somehow involved in it. And you tend not to do that. But it's time to open them. I can't tell you whether or not they're going to find anything of interest. And I did partially open, I think I've opened 50%, but I was asked not to do it and I, I, I thought that was a reasonable ask. But now I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it very soon. There's a lot of interest in it.

[02:45:14]
One of the things that I have.

[02:45:15]
Interest in the people coming from space, you know?

[02:45:19]
Yes.

[02:45:19]
And I know you're interested.

[02:45:20]
Oh, very interested in that. How much they tell you about that?

[02:45:23]
A lot.

[02:45:23]
Really?

[02:45:24]
Yeah.

[02:45:24]
What they tell you? How much can you tell?

[02:45:27]
So I.

[02:45:27]
How's that work? Is it like super top secret. Tell me.

[02:45:30]
Well, based on Hunter Biden, I can say whatever the hell I want, right? But no, but I interviewed a few people. It's never been my thing. I have to be honest. I have never been a believer. I have people that Area 51 or whatever it is, I think it's the number one tourist attraction in the whole country or something. Area 51 in Las Vegas. Do you know that? Right?

[02:45:49]
Sure, I know what it is.

[02:45:50]
So anyway. But it's a big tourist thing. So I interviewed jet pilots that say they saw something. If you saw them, you'd love to have them, as you said.

[02:46:01]
I've had a couple in here. Commander David Fravor, I had him in. Who had that sighting in 2004. Very, very compelling. With visual video evidence, radar evidence.

[02:46:12]
Ryan Graves, I don't believe his name. But I interviewed jet pilots that were solid people, perfect. I mean, great pilots, great everything. And they said, we saw things, sir, that were very strange, like a round ball. But it wasn't a comet or a meteor. It was something. And it was going four times faster than an F22, which is a very fast plane, you know, and it was round, which is in theory a great shape.

[02:46:44]
So when you were talking to these people, was this something that you were compelled to have conversations? Was this your personal interest?

[02:46:53]
A little bit. It's not a great interest for me, but it's a little interest. I get that question as much as almost any question. Do you think that we have aliens coming, you know, flying around or whatever?

[02:47:04]
What do you think?

[02:47:06]
There's no reason not to. I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life, you know, because, well.

[02:47:13]
Mars, we've had probes there and rovers, and I don't think there's any life there.

[02:47:17]
Well, maybe it's life that we don't know, but.

[02:47:19]
Well, maybe there was life there at one point. Point in time. This is the speculation about Mars, that Mars had an atmosphere at one point in time, a long time ago that could support life. It also had large bodies of water. But we've had no evidence of even bacterial life that exists on Mars. But the universe has been pretty bad.

[02:47:35]
It's not been a thing for me. I mean, when I looked at what China did to this, admit they would have never done it with me, where they put the balloon up, and a lot of people thought, And a lot of people thought for a little while that that was one of these things.

[02:47:47]
Well, that's a lot of the Speculation, too, that some of these drones that hover over battleships, that these are Chinese drones and that they're not UFOs.

[02:47:54]
They could be.

[02:47:54]
Also, there's some super sophisticated.

[02:47:55]
But I did interview, let's say, three or four guys that. And without tremendous interest, if you had them, as I said, you'd love to have them as your children. Solid, beautiful people. They said, sir, there's something there. You know, they've.

[02:48:14]
There's something there. Yeah, yeah. I've talked to quite a few of them.

[02:48:17]
They're not conspiracy.

[02:48:18]
Well, I mean, just the Commander David fravor thing. In 2004, off the coast of San Diego, they clocked that thing going from 50,000ft above sea level to 50 in a second. They don't know what it is.

[02:48:29]
That's tough to beat.

[02:48:30]
Yeah, they saw something in the water. It was hovering over that something that was making a disturbance in the water. They got video evidence of this thing. Two different fighter jets with pilots in them saw it. There's, you know, visual evidence, photographic evidence, video evidence, radar evidence, evidence. Whatever the hell it is, it moves in a way that would turn a human being in a Jello. If they're inside of it, the G force, no one would survive. Oh, so, like, what is that? And we don't. It doesn't have a heatness signature. They don't know what their propulsion system was.

[02:49:00]
But when you fly in some of these jets, these pilots have to be in great shape.

[02:49:05]
Oh, yeah, I flew with the Blue Angels once. Yeah, I got to fly, I guess.

[02:49:10]
And those are older machines, and they're crazy. When you. When you fly, somebody's saying, yeah, but I can imagine you gotta be special.

[02:49:17]
But these things that these people are encountering are far superior to what we know of.

[02:49:22]
Yeah.

[02:49:22]
Is it possible that there's some military or government program that you weren't that they didn't tell you about?

[02:49:31]
I think I had a great relationship with the military, basically. But, you know, I didn't like certain people. I would have gotten them out if I thought. If I were. If the election was different, I would have fired, you know, all of them quickly. Most of them. I did fire. Biden should have fired every military person involved with Afghanistan. He should have had a lot of firings. You know, if you look at him, he told Israel not to do anything. And at least Israel is not going to look at a bomb the way they would have been. Think if they listened to Biden, they'd be waiting for a bomb to drop on their head. Right now, he's been wrong about so much. I guess you'd have to say that she's been wrong, too, because you. She always said they made the decision together, but Israel didn't follow his advice. And I think it was a very. You know, it's a very. The Middle east is rapidly changing. You know, there are prophets that say the world will come to an end in the Middle East. You know that, right? And we have weapons today that are so scary when you look.

[02:50:33]
I rebuilt them. And when you look at the weapons we have today, the biggest threat we have in the world today is nuclear weapons. And we have other weapons, too, that are devastated. But the nuclear weapons, the biggest threat we have in the world today, and that's what you. I was talking about de escalation with both China and Russia. I'm telling you, we were going to de escalate. They were going to de escalate. You got to be careful. It's a little tricky playing with them because they say we're going to do it and they don't do it. Maybe, but they understood the curse, too. It's a curse. China's way behind us, but they'll catch us within five years.

[02:51:11]
So let's imagine, let's say you win in November. What do you do differently? And how do you change this course that it seems we are on for World War 3? How do you get us out of Ukraine? How do you stop what's going on in the Middle East? How do you put a stop to this?

[02:51:27]
Well, it's a very. To me, it's an easy question because I think I can do it easily. But it's a complex question in the sense that the times change. Every day changes. Who's winning, who's not winning. I mean, Russia is a war machine, whether you like it or not. It just grinds along, grinds along. You speak to people like Viktor Orban, he'll tell you it's just a big fat war machine. And that's what's happening. You look at what's happened to Ukraine. If I were there, it would have never happened.

[02:52:00]
But what could you do now? If you get into office in January, what could you do now?

[02:52:05]
Right now, you would get both of them. I know both very well. And again, I cannot, I do not want to tell you for the purpose of looking smart to five people that say, oh, he was great, because. Because if I told you exactly what I do, I could never make the deal. All I can tell you is that I would meet with Putin and I would meet with him And I know exactly what I'd say to each one of them. And I believe that as President elect, I would get that war stopped and stopped fast. You know, we have tremendous power in the United States, if you know how to use the power. I stopped other wars just by the use of tariffs. I got Macron of France, good guys, like a friend of mine, but he's a wise guy and he's a person that likes France, and he was going to tax our companies. I say, and I sent all the smartest guys. I sent Mnuchin. They all failed me. And I said, I'll do it myself. And I called him. I said, emmanuel, you're taxing American companies. We're not going to allow you to do that.

[02:53:06]
Oh, Donald, I cannot do. Nothing I could do. It's already been pbutted. I said, emmanuel, if you do that, I'm going to put 100% tariff when your wines and champagnes are coming to the United States, and you're going to regret that you ever did it. He said, donald, please, that's not fair. Anyway, within about two minutes, he dropped the whole thing. And it was mbuttive amounts of money against American companies. I have to protect American companies.

[02:53:30]
So why doesn't the Biden administration do this?

[02:53:32]
Because they're incompetent. They don't know how to talk. Look, they met in Alaska with the Chinese, and the Chinese lectured them about how badly we treat people. Right? Okay. I mean, think of it. You remember that? It was like an American. They didn't talk to me that way. They never. They respected me. They respected our country. They don't respect our country. They don't respect Biden. They don't respect her. They're dreaming about her because she's incompetent. She's not a smart person. Look, she can't put two sentences together. She talks. I watch her two nights. I watched her last night, too. It was the same thing. She's not a smart person. These guys are very smart, and they're very streetwise, and they're very tricky and evil and dangerous. And if she becomes the President of the United States, which I can't believe can happen happen, I don't think this country is going to make it. I don't think we'll ever be. I think just really bad things will happen to our country. And you know what? I look at the outside forces and I say, they can all be handled because we have a pot of gold, but we're not going to have that pot of gold to play with anymore.

[02:54:46]
You know, It's a great negotiating thing. I told you, I knocked out this mbuttive car company going to take all of our car business from Detroit. Detroit. I knocked it out just by my rhetoric. Rhetorically. I said, they'll never sell a car in here. I'll put tariffs, I don't care. They're 2,000%. They're never going to build that plant in.

[02:55:06]
Is it possible to apply that same thing to the electronics that we use? One of the things that disturbs me greatly is that all of our phones are made overseas. And then some of our phones are made in places like yes. And the chips and some of our phones are made in places like Foxconn where they have nets around the building to keep people from jumping off the roof because they have so many suicides. Like, wouldn't it be better to have an American made iPhone where, you know, people are paid good wages, they have health insurance, they're taken care of, they can live a good life where you're not buying a piece of electronics that's cheaper because someone has to suffer in a horrible way. That's not even legal in the United States. It's not even legal to have them work that way in the United States. So they get these people to build them over.

[02:55:46]
You do it. But let me just say, that chip deal is so bad, we put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here. And they're not going to give us the good companies anyway. All you had to do is charge them tariffs. If you were to put a tariff on the chips coming in, you would have been able to. Just like the auto companies. No different. More sophisticated, but no different. You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business, okay? They want us to protect and they want protection. They don't pay us money for the protection. You know, the mob makes you pay money, right? But with these countries that we protect, I got hundreds of billions of dollars from NATO countries that were never paying us. And my biggest fan is Stoltenberg, who just left as the, you know, Director General, as the Secretary General. Good guy. He said Bush came, he made a speech. Obama came, he made a speech, Trump came. He said, you guys aren't paying, you got to pay. And they said, will you protect us from Russia if we don't?

[02:56:49]
I said, no, you got to pay. If you don't pay, billions of dollars came in to NATO. When I see us paying a lot of money to have people build chips, that's not the way. You didn't have to put up 10 cents. You could have done it with a series of tariffs. In other words, you tar tariff, it's so high that they will come and build their chip companies for nothing. In other words, Joe, you put a big tariff on the chips coming in. I say you don't have to pay the tariff. All you have to do is build your plant in the United States. We didn't have to give them the money to build a plant. Besides that, they're very rich companies. These chip companies. They stole 95% of our business. It's in Taiwan right now. They do a great job, but that's only because we have stupid politicians. We lost the chip business, and now we think we're going to pay. You can't build it that way. You have to make them spend their money in the United States, and those plants would open up all over and they'll fund them. We don't have to put up 10 cents.

[02:57:48]
And I am in the process of making a huge speech in about a little while. And you and I. How long have we been talking?

[02:57:54]
A long time.

[02:57:55]
Let's go.

[02:57:56]
Probably like three hours.

[02:57:57]
I got to make a speech, but we'll do it again. I want to do it again with you. You are something. I said, how long will this last? Anywhere from an hour to three or four hours.

[02:58:07]
How long we do, Jamie? Three hours.

[02:58:09]
Good. Well, we'll do it again. I thought it was great. I think it's.

[02:58:12]
I think it was great. It was.

[02:58:13]
You are a fascinating guy, and you've done a great job.

[02:58:17]
Thank you very much.

[02:58:18]
And thank you very much. It's been an honor.

[02:58:20]
It's been an honor.

[02:58:21]
I'm going to make a great speech, and I'm going to say. And if I'm a little off tonight, I'm going to blame you. I spoke to this guy for three hours. Anyway, it's a great honor to be.

[02:58:31]
Thank you, sir.

[02:58:31]
Thank you.

[02:58:32]
Good luck to you.

[02:58:32]
Thank you very much.

[02:58:33]
Appreciate it.

[02:58:33]
All right.

[02:58:34]
Bye, everybody.
